## Execution Instructions

### How to Run This

From a fresh Claude Code session in the `~/projects/namkuzu-da/` directory, give the following instruction:

```
Read /home/spicymeatball/Google-Drive/BigPic - Invest/Research/RESEARCH_TRACKER.md and execute all 6 pending sector research pipelines. For each sector, follow the exact process documented below. Run all 6 sectors in parallel using a team of agents — one agent per sector.
```

### Per-Sector Pipeline (what each agent does)

Each sector agent runs this pipeline end-to-end:

**Step 1 — Research (4 sequential sub-topics):**
For each of the 4 research areas listed in the sector definition above:
- Do thorough web research (current data, company filings, earnings, market projections, industry reports)
- Write a numbered markdown file: `01_*.md`, `02_*.md`, `03_*.md`, `04_*.md`
- Each file should be 15-30K chars (match the depth of completed sectors)
- Each file MUST end with a `## Sources` section containing `- [Title](URL)` links for every data point cited
- Include: market size data with dollar figures, public company analysis with tickers/market caps/metrics, growth projections with timeframes, risk factors, competitive dynamics

**Step 2 — Compile THESIS.md:**
Read all 4 research files and synthesize into `THESIS.md` with this structure:
```
# [Sector] Investment Thesis
*Compiled: [Date]*
*Source files: 01_*.md, 02_*.md, 03_*.md, 04_*.md*

## Executive Summary
(2-3 paragraphs: core thesis, key tension/risk, why now)

## Industry Overview & Market Size
(Data tables: market size, growth rates, key metrics)

## Key Sectors
(4 sections matching the 4 research areas, each with company tables, data, analysis)

## Public Company Analysis
(Comprehensive ticker table: company, ticker, market cap, key metric, conviction tier)

## Investment Timing Framework
- Near-term (0-6 months): catalysts, events
- Mid-term (6-18 months): structural shifts
- Long-term (2-5 years): secular trends

## Risk Factors
(Numbered list with severity assessment)

## Recommended Watchlist
| Tier | Ticker | Company | Rationale |
(Tier 1 = highest conviction, Tier 2 = strong, Tier 3 = speculative)

## Sources & References
(Aggregated and deduplicated from all 4 reports)
```

**Step 3 — Generate Interactive HTML Report:**
Create a single self-contained HTML file (embedded CSS/JS) with:
- Dark theme driven by the sector's aesthetic (colors and motifs specified per sector above)
- Hero section with 5-6 animated counters (key market stats)
- Market overview with data tables/heatmaps
- Sector breakdown with charts (bar charts, donuts, area charts)
- Filterable company cards by conviction tier (Tier 1/2/3 filter buttons)
- Catalyst timeline visualization
- Risk assessment grid
- Collapsible "Sources & References" section at bottom with clickable links
- Scroll-reveal animations, hover states, tooltips throughout
- Responsive layout

**CRITICAL HTML BUG TO AVOID:**
- Bar charts: use `align-items: stretch` on `.bar-chart` containers (NOT `flex-end` — that causes bars to render as 4px slivers because percentage heights fail without a fixed-height parent)
- Bar groups: use `justify-content: flex-end` on `.bar-group` to keep bars anchored to the bottom
- Gridline values: order high-to-low in HTML, use `justify-content: space-between` on the gridline container

**Quality reference:** Use completed HTML reports as the quality bar:
- `/home/spicymeatball/Google-Drive/BigPic - Invest/Research/Space/Space_Investment_Report.html`
- `/home/spicymeatball/Google-Drive/BigPic - Invest/Research/AI/AI_Infrastructure_Report.html`
- `/home/spicymeatball/Google-Drive/BigPic - Invest/Research/Energy/Nuclear_Energy_Report.html`

Read at least one of these before generating HTML to match the quality, structure, and interactivity level.

### Team Structure

Recommended approach:
1. Create a team (`TeamCreate`)
2. Create 6 tasks (one per sector) with `TaskCreate`
3. Spawn 6 agents in parallel using `Task` tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, one per sector
4. Each agent writes all files for their sector (4 research MDs + THESIS.md + HTML)
5. As agents complete, update the tracker table below (move from "In Progress" to "Completed")
6. After all 6 complete, update PROMPTS.md `Completed Research` table with all new sectors
7. Shut down team

### Agent Prompt Template

For each sector agent, use this prompt (fill in the sector-specific values):

```
You are researching [SECTOR_NAME] as an investment thesis.

Store all files in: /home/spicymeatball/Google-Drive/BigPic - Invest/Research/[FOLDER]/

STEP 1 — RESEARCH: Write 4 deep-dive research reports:
1. [FILE_01] — [DESCRIPTION_01]
2. [FILE_02] — [DESCRIPTION_02]
3. [FILE_03] — [DESCRIPTION_03]
4. [FILE_04] — [DESCRIPTION_04]

Each report should be 15-30K characters with current data (2025-2026), company analysis with
tickers and market caps, growth projections, competitive dynamics, and risk factors.
EVERY report MUST end with a ## Sources section with linked URLs for all data cited.

Key tickers to investigate: [TICKER_LIST]

STEP 2 — COMPILE: Read all 4 reports and compile THESIS.md with: Executive Summary,
Industry Overview & Market Size (with data tables), Key Sectors (4 sections matching reports),
Public Company Analysis, Investment Timing Framework (near/mid/long-term), Risk Factors,
Recommended Watchlist (Tier 1/2/3 conviction), Sources & References.

STEP 3 — HTML: Generate [HTML_FILENAME] as a single self-contained interactive data story.
Theme: [COLOR_THEME]. Read the reference report at
/home/spicymeatball/Google-Drive/BigPic - Invest/Research/AI/AI_Infrastructure_Report.html
for quality/structure/interactivity benchmarking.

CRITICAL: Bar charts must use align-items:stretch (NOT flex-end). Bar groups use
justify-content:flex-end. Gridline values ordered high-to-low.

Include: hero with animated counters, market data tables, sector charts (bars/donuts/area),
filterable company cards by conviction tier, catalyst timeline, risk grid, collapsible
sources section, scroll-reveal animations, hover tooltips. Responsive and visually striking.
```

- [ ] Update thesis integration in Eagle Eye and Morning Brief (add new sector watchlists to the prompts)
  - Edit `/home/spicymeatball/projects/namkuzu-da/toolbox/eagle-eye` — add new THESIS_* variables
  - Edit `/home/spicymeatball/projects/namkuzu-da/toolbox/morning-brief` — add new THESIS_* variables
