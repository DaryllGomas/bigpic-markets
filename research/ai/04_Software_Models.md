---

## 8. MLOps & AI Infrastructure Software

**Market size**: $3.2B (2025) -> $4.5B (2026), CAGR 41.8%. Projected to reach $56.6B by 2035.

### Key Players
| Company | Status | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Weights & Biases** | Private | Developer-first MLOps; experiment tracking |
| **Dataiku** | Private | Low-code MLOps; enterprise governance |
| **DataRobot** | Private | AutoML + MLOps platform |
| **MLflow** | Open-source (Databricks) | ML lifecycle management standard |
| **Comet ML** | Private | Experiment management |
| **Neptune.ai** | Private | Metadata store for ML |

| **Milvus/Zilliz** | Open-source + cloud | Scale-focused | LF AI Foundation project |
| **Chroma** | Open-source | Developer-friendly, lightweight | Early stage |

**Key trend**: Pricing shifting from "per pod" to "serverless consumption" -- good for startups, expensive at scale.

**62% of organizations** deploying RAG report improved model performance with optimized vector DBs.

**Consolidation risk**: PostgreSQL (pgvector), MongoDB, Elasticsearch all adding vector capabilities -- standalone pure-plays may face commoditization.

## 12. Valuation Multiples & Comparisons

### Private AI Companies
| Tier | EV/Revenue Range | Examples |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Frontier model cos** | 30-70x | OpenAI (~15-25x on $20B), Anthropic (~35-70x on $5B), xAI |
| **AI infrastructure** | 20-30x | Databricks (~28x on $4.8B) |
| **Enterprise AI** | 10-25x | Cohere (~47x on $150M), Mistral |
| **AI tools/startups** | 25-30x median | Broad market |

### Public AI-Adjacent Software
| Company | Ticker | EV/Rev (NTM) | Rev Growth | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Palantir** | PLTR | ~35x | 61% guided | Premium for AI platform positioning |
| **CrowdStrike** | CRWD | ~20x | 22% | Cybersecurity + AI |
| **Snowflake** | SNOW | ~15-18x | 28-32% | Data cloud for AI |
| **Datadog** | DDOG | ~15-17x | 28% | AI observability |
| **MongoDB** | MDB | ~12-15x | 30% | AI application data |
| **ServiceNow** | NOW | ~16-18x | 22% | Enterprise AI workflows |
| **Salesforce** | CRM | ~8-9x | ~10% | Agentforce growing fast |
| **UiPath** | PATH | ~8-10x | 16% | Agentic automation |
| **SentinelOne** | S | ~12-14x | 23% | AI-native security |

**Key observation**: AI fundraising at ~25-30x EV/Revenue vs public SaaS at ~6x median. Massive gap implies either private market froth or public market undervaluation of AI growth.

## 13. Chatbot / Foundation Model Market Share

### Web Traffic Share (Similarweb, Jan 2026)
| Platform | Jan 2025 | Jan 2026 | Change |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| ChatGPT | 87.2% | 68.0% | -19.2pp |
| Google Gemini | 5.4% | 18.2% | +12.8pp |
| Claude | ~2% | ~3% | +1pp |
| Perplexity | ~1% | ~4% | +3pp |

### Mobile App Share
| Platform | Jan 2025 | Jan 2026 | Change |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| ChatGPT | 69.1% | 45.3% | -23.8pp |
| Gemini | 14.7% | 25.2% | +10.5pp |

### Enterprise Market (approximate)
- Anthropic Claude: ~33%
- OpenAI: ~25%
- Google Gemini: ~20%

## 14. Bull vs Bear on AI Monetization

### Bull Case
- Big 5 hyperscalers spending $600B+ on AI in 2026 -- creates massive revenue for picks-and-shovels layer
- AI revenue already materializing: OpenAI $20B+, Anthropic $5B+, enterprise AI tools growing 20-60% YoY
- "As fast as we install AI capacity, it's getting monetized" -- Amazon CEO Jassy
- AI improving productivity measurably: $3.50 ROI per $1 invested (IBM); GitHub Copilot 55% faster coding
- Agentic AI is the next inflection -- 40% of enterprise apps by 2026 (Gartner)
- Multiple revenue models working: subscriptions, consumption, platform fees, inference-as-a-service

### Bear Case
- AI services generate only **~$25B in direct revenue** vs $600B+ infrastructure spend -- 4% monetization rate
- **42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives** in 2025 (up from 17% in 2024)
- **70-85% of AI projects fail** to meet expectations (MIT/RAND)
- Hyperscalers issued $121B in debt in 2025; another $100B expected in 2026 -- risk if revenue doesn't follow
- Foundation model companies burning cash: OpenAI $8B loss, Anthropic break-even not until 2028
- Valuation gap: private AI at 25-30x revenue vs public SaaS at 6x -- correction risk
- Open-source (Llama, Mistral) could commoditize model layer, compressing margins
- Enterprise "pilot purgatory" -- adoption announcements != revenue

### Key Question for 2026
The market is shifting from "promise phase" to "proof phase." In 2024-2025, investors rewarded AI narrative. In 2026, they demand ROI evidence. The market is now separating **AI monetizers** (companies generating real AI revenue) from **AI manufacturers** (companies spending on infrastructure hoping for future returns).

## 15. Key Investment Themes

1. **Model layer is concentrating**: 3-4 players (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta) will dominate; smaller players (Mistral, Cohere, AI21) face margin pressure or acquisition
2. **Application layer is the real opportunity**: Enterprise AI software (Palantir, ServiceNow, Salesforce) converting AI capabilities into recurring revenue at 20-60% growth
3. **AI coding is the killer app**: $7.4B market with 42% Copilot share; Cursor disrupting fast; 90% dev adoption by 2028 -- most tangible productivity gain
4. **Agentic AI is next wave**: 46% CAGR market; Salesforce Agentforce 330% growth shows early traction
5. **Data infrastructure is the backbone**: Databricks ($134B private), Snowflake, MongoDB all growing 28-55% on AI workloads -- no AI without data
6. **Security is dual-play**: AI improves security + AI creates new attack surface -- CrowdStrike, Palo Alto benefit both ways
7. **IPO wave incoming**: Databricks, Anthropic, potentially OpenAI in 2026-2027 -- largest tech IPO cycle since 2020-2021
8. **Valuation reset risk**: Private AI multiples (25-30x) far exceed public SaaS (6x) -- either private markets correct or public multiples expand
9. **Open-source vs closed debate**: Meta's Llama strategy could commoditize the model layer, benefiting application-layer companies
10. **The 4% problem**: Only $25B AI revenue on $600B+ infrastructure spend -- bull thesis requires this ratio to improve dramatically in 2026-2027
