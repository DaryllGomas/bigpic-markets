## 1. Hyperscaler AI Capex (2024-2026)

The defining story of AI infrastructure is the unprecedented capital expenditure by the four major hyperscalers. Spending has accelerated dramatically year over year.

### Annual Capex by Company

| Company | 2024 Actual | 2025 Actual | 2026 Projected |
|---------|------------|------------|----------------|
| Amazon (AMZN) | $77B | $100-105B | ~$200B |
| Microsoft (MSFT) | ~$55B | ~$80B | ~$145B (run-rate) |
| Alphabet (GOOGL) | ~$50B | ~$75B | $175-185B |
| Meta (META) | ~$37B | $60-65B | $115-135B |
| **Combined** | **~$241B*** | **~$400B** | **~$650B** |

*\*Includes Oracle in 2024 aggregate figure*

**Key Observations:**
- 2024 to 2025 represented a ~60% increase in combined capex
- 2026 projections show another ~63% increase, approaching $650B combined
- Amazon alone plans to spend more in 2026 ($200B) than all hyperscalers combined spent in 2024
- Nearly all incremental spend is earmarked for data centers, AI chips, networking, and backup power
- Cash reserves are taking significant hits; this spending rate is testing even Big Tech balance sheets

### What They're Buying
- AI accelerators (Nvidia GPUs, custom ASICs like Google TPUs, Amazon Trainium)
- Data center land and construction
- Networking equipment (800G/1.6T switches, fiber)
- Power infrastructure (generators, UPS, transformers)
- Cooling systems (increasingly liquid cooling)

## 4. The Power Crisis

### Demand Projections

| Metric | Current | 2026 | 2028 | 2030 |
|--------|---------|------|------|------|
| US Data Center IT Power | ~40 GW | 75.8 GW | 108 GW | 134.4 GW |
| % of US Electricity | ~4% | ~5-6% | 6.7-12% | ~10-15% |
| Global DC Consumption | ~460 TWh | - | - | ~945 TWh |

- Global data center power demand growing 175% by 2030 vs. 2023 levels
- AI is the primary driver; AI workloads are 5-10x more power-intensive per rack than traditional compute
- To support 85 GW of incremental demand, approximately 100 GW of total new capacity needed (including surplus)

### Grid Constraints
- **Permitting delays:** Transmission expansion blocked by multi-year permitting processes
- **Supply chain:** Transformer lead times stretched to 2-4 years
- **Infrastructure cost:** Goldman Sachs estimates ~$720B in grid spending needed through 2030
- **Peak crunch period:** 2028-2029 before new gas/nuclear capacity comes online
- **PJM capacity auction:** Cleared at $269.92/MW-day in 2025/2026 (nearly 10x prior year); subsequent auctions hit FERC price cap above $329/MW-day

### Implications
- Power availability is now the #1 constraint on data center growth (surpassing land and fiber)
- Companies with existing power contracts or on-site generation have massive competitive advantages
- Behind-the-meter solutions (on-site gas turbines, fuel cells, nuclear) gaining traction

## Investment Themes & Key Takeaways

### 1. Power is the New Bottleneck
The #1 constraint on AI infrastructure growth is no longer chips or capital -- it is electricity. US data center power demand is projected to grow from ~40 GW today to 134 GW by 2030. Grid interconnection timelines of 2-4 years and transformer shortages are forcing companies to pursue on-site power generation.

### 2. The Capex Supercycle is Real
$650B in hyperscaler capex in 2026 alone is unprecedented. This creates a massive addressable market for every layer of the infrastructure stack, from power generation to cooling to networking.

### 3. Nuclear Renaissance
Tech companies have signed 20-year nuclear PPAs worth tens of billions. Constellation Energy and Vistra are the primary beneficiaries today. SMRs (Oklo, NuScale) are longer-term bets with significant execution and regulatory risk -- first deployments not until 2028-2030 at earliest.

### 4. Picks-and-Shovels Plays
Companies selling infrastructure to data center builders have the most visible revenue streams:
- **Power equipment:** Eaton ($15.3B backlog), Vertiv ($9.5B backlog), Quanta ($39.2B backlog)
- **Networking:** Arista (30% revenue growth, #1 in 800G)
- **Fiber:** Corning (39% optical growth, 58% enterprise growth)
- **Cooling:** Liquid cooling market growing 22-26% CAGR

### 5. Data Center REITs Have Pricing Power
With vacancy near all-time lows and demand far outstripping supply, REITs like Digital Realty and Equinix are achieving 6-8% cash releasing spreads on renewals. The constraint is not demand but how fast they can build.

### 6. Natural Gas is the Bridge
Nuclear is a 5-10 year solution. Natural gas can be deployed in 2-3 years. Williams Companies ($5.1B committed to power plants), Kinder Morgan (40% of US gas transmission), and EQT (largest US gas producer) are positioned as the bridge infrastructure.

### 7. Risk Factors
- **Demand durability:** If AI workload growth slows, $650B in capex could lead to overcapacity
- **Interest rates:** Higher rates increase cost of capital for capital-intensive REITs and utilities
- **Regulation:** Nuclear permitting, environmental pushback on gas, grid interconnection reform
- **Technology shifts:** More efficient AI models (inference optimization) could reduce power demand growth
- **Execution risk:** Many companies are trading at elevated multiples that assume flawless execution
