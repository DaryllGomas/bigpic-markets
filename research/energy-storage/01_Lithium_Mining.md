# Lithium Supply Chain: From Brine to Battery

## Executive Summary

Lithium sits at the foundation of the global energy storage revolution. As the lightest metal and the electrochemical backbone of every major battery chemistry, lithium supply dynamics directly determine the pace of electrification. The lithium market has endured a brutal cycle since 2022 — prices peaked near $80,000/tonne before crashing below $10,000/tonne by mid-2024, triggering mine curtailments, project deferrals, and corporate restructuring across the industry. As of early 2026, prices have rebounded to approximately $20,000/tonne, driven by surging energy storage demand and tightening supply fundamentals. This report examines the full lithium supply chain — extraction methods, major producers, pricing dynamics, emerging DLE technology, and the nascent recycling ecosystem — to identify the investment-grade opportunities and structural risks shaping this critical commodity.

## 1. Extraction Methods: Brine, Hard Rock, and DLE

### 1.1 Brine Extraction

Brine-based lithium extraction accounts for roughly one-third of global lithium production and dominates in South America's "Lithium Triangle" — spanning Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. The process involves pumping lithium-rich underground brine into a series of shallow evaporation ponds where solar energy concentrates the lithium over 12-18 months. The concentrated brine then undergoes chemical processing to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) or lithium hydroxide (LiOH).

**Salar de Atacama (Chile):** The world's highest-grade lithium brine deposit, with concentrations exceeding 1,500 mg/L lithium. SQM and Albemarle operate here under concessions from CORFO (Chile's economic development agency). The Atacama's arid climate and high lithium concentrations make it the lowest-cost lithium source globally, with production costs historically in the $3,500-$5,000/tonne LCE range. However, water usage concerns and evolving government royalty structures are increasing effective costs.

**Argentina's Lithium Triangle:** Argentina hosts the Salar de Hombre Muerto (operated by Arcadium Lithium / now Rio Tinto), Cauchari-Olaroz (Ganfeng-Lithium Americas JV), and numerous greenfield projects. Argentina's brine concentrations are generally lower than Atacama (300-600 mg/L), requiring longer evaporation times and higher processing costs. However, Argentina offers a more favorable regulatory environment with provincial mining authority, lower royalties (3% vs. Chile's escalating structure), and no state ownership mandates.

**Process Economics:** Brine operations require $400-600M in upfront capital for pond construction and processing facilities, with 2-4 year construction timelines. Operating costs average $5,580/tonne LCE across brine operations globally. The key advantage is that brine operations produce finished lithium chemicals directly (carbonate or hydroxide), commanding higher prices than hard rock concentrates. Brine operations' operating margins are nearly twice those of hard-rock assets when measured on a per-tonne LCE basis.

**Disadvantages:** The 12-18 month evaporation timeline creates significant lag between investment decisions and production response. Water usage in arid regions faces increasing regulatory and social opposition. Lithium recovery rates from conventional evaporation are typically 40-60%, meaning substantial lithium is left behind.

### 1.2 Hard Rock (Spodumene) Mining

Hard rock lithium mining, primarily from spodumene-bearing pegmatite deposits, accounts for approximately 60% of current global lithium supply. Australia dominates hard rock production, led by the Greenbushes mine (Talison Lithium, a JV between Albemarle and IGO/Tianqi) and Pilgangoora (Pilbara Minerals).

**Production Process:** Spodumene ore is mined via open pit, crushed, and processed through dense media separation to produce spodumene concentrate (SC6 at 6% Li2O). This concentrate is then shipped — predominantly to China — for conversion into lithium carbonate or hydroxide via roasting at 1,050 degrees C followed by acid leaching and purification. Increasingly, producers are building conversion capacity in Australia (Albemarle's Kemerton, Tianqi's Kwinana) to capture downstream value.

**Cost Structure:** Hard rock concentrate production costs average approximately $2,540/tonne LCE at the mine gate, making concentrate cheaper to produce than brine chemicals. However, the concentrate must then undergo energy-intensive conversion, adding $3,000-5,000/tonne in processing costs. Total integrated costs for Australian spodumene-to-hydroxide operations run $8,000-12,000/tonne, making them higher-cost than Chilean brine. Pilbara Minerals guided FY2026 unit operating costs at $560-600/tonne of spodumene concentrate (before conversion).

**Advantages:** Hard rock mines can be brought online in 2-3 years versus 4-7 years for brine, providing faster supply response. Production is not weather-dependent. Deposits are found in politically stable jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, Brazil).

**Disadvantages:** Higher energy intensity, carbon footprint, and waste rock generation. Concentrate pricing is tied to volatile spot markets. Conversion capacity has become a bottleneck — most conversion occurs in China, creating supply chain concentration risk.

### 1.3 Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)

DLE represents the most transformative emerging technology in the lithium industry. Rather than relying on months-long solar evaporation, DLE technologies use chemical or physical processes to selectively extract lithium from brine in hours, achieving recovery rates above 90% (versus 40-60% for conventional evaporation).

**Three Primary DLE Approaches:**

1. **Adsorption / Ion Exchange:** Uses solid sorbent materials (lithium titanate, lithium manganese oxide, or proprietary ion exchange media) to selectively capture lithium ions from brine. The sorbent is then washed with acid or water to release concentrated lithium. Lilac Solutions leads this approach with its Gen 5 ion exchange technology, achieving 87% recovery on ultra-low-grade brines (69 mg/L lithium) at the Great Salt Lake. Standard Lithium's LiSTR process also uses adsorption.

2. **Solvent Extraction:** Uses organic solvents that selectively bind lithium ions. EnergyX's LiTAS platform combines solvent extraction with proprietary membranes, achieving 94%+ recovery rates with minimal freshwater usage.

3. **Membrane Separation:** Uses selective membranes (electrodialysis, nanofiltration) to separate lithium from other ions. Often combined with other DLE methods as a polishing step.

**Timeline to Commercial Scale:** No DLE technology has yet achieved sustained commercial-scale production, though several are approaching this milestone. Standard Lithium's Phase 1A project at the LANXESS South Plant in Arkansas anticipates first production of battery-quality lithium carbonate in 2026, with average annual output of 5,400 tonnes LCE. Lilac Solutions completed construction of its commercial-scale ion exchange media manufacturing line in Fernley, Nevada in January 2026, with production beginning mid-2026, and its Great Salt Lake Phase 1 facility targeting 2027 startup.

**DLE Advantages:** 90%+ recovery rates (vs. 40-60% for evaporation), hours instead of months for extraction, dramatically lower water consumption and land footprint, ability to process low-grade and unconventional brines (geothermal, oilfield, continental), and potential to unlock lithium resources in the US, Europe, and other non-traditional regions.

**DLE Risks:** No technology has proven sustained commercial-scale operation. Capital costs are uncertain. Sorbent/membrane degradation rates in real-world conditions are not fully characterized. Multiple competing technologies create winner-take-most risk for individual companies.

## 2. Major Producers

### 2.1 Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB)

**Profile:** The world's largest lithium producer by revenue, Albemarle operates across the full lithium value chain from brine and hard rock extraction to chemical processing. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | ALB (NYSE) |
| Market Cap | ~$19B (Feb 2026) |
| Revenue (TTM) | ~$4.9B (2025) |
| Adj. EBITDA Margin | ~25% (expanding) |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | 2.1x |
| Key Assets | Silver Peak (NV brine), Greenbushes JV (AU hard rock), Kemerton (AU conversion), La Negra (Chile) |
| 2025 Avg Li Price | ~$9.50/kg ($9,500/tonne) |

**Operations:**
- **Silver Peak, Nevada:** The only producing lithium mine in the United States. A brine operation approximately 200 miles northwest of Las Vegas, with an estimated 30+ years of remaining resource life. Production is modest (approximately 5,000 tonnes LCE/year), but strategically important for US domestic supply and IRA qualification.
- **Talison (Greenbushes) JV:** 49% ownership of the world's largest and lowest-cost hard rock lithium mine in Western Australia. The Greenbushes mine produces spodumene concentrate that feeds Albemarle's and Tianqi's downstream conversion plants.
- **Kings Mountain Restart:** Supported by over $240M in federal grants, Albemarle is reopening the historic Kings Mountain mine in North Carolina. Full-scale operations expected to begin later in 2026. This will be a significant addition to US domestic lithium supply and qualifies for IRA incentives.
- **Kemerton (Australia):** Lithium hydroxide conversion plant in Western Australia. Albemarle paused expansion during the 2024-2025 downturn, reducing capacity by half to approximately 25,000 tonnes/year to preserve capital.
- **La Negra (Chile):** Lithium carbonate and hydroxide processing facility supplied by Atacama brine.

**Cost Position & Strategy:** Albemarle achieved approximately $450M in annual cost savings through its restructuring program, exceeding the original $300-400M target. The company prioritized balance sheet strength during the downturn, pausing discretionary spending while maintaining core operations. Q3 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $226M was up 7% quarter-over-quarter. With net debt/EBITDA at 2.1x, Albemarle has financial flexibility to restart deferred projects as prices recover.

**Investment Thesis:** Albemarle offers the most diversified lithium exposure — geographically (US, Australia, Chile), by extraction method (brine + hard rock), and across the value chain (mining, conversion, specialty chemicals). The Kings Mountain restart provides US-sourced lithium eligible for IRA tax credits, a significant competitive advantage. The stock traded at depressed valuations during the lithium downturn and is positioned for rerating as prices recover. Key risks include continued lithium price weakness, execution risk on Kings Mountain, and Chinese conversion competition.

### 2.2 SQM — Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE: SQM)

**Profile:** Chile's dominant lithium producer, operating in the Salar de Atacama — the world's highest-grade and lowest-cost lithium brine resource.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | SQM (NYSE) |
| Market Cap | ~$12-14B (est. 2026) |
| Revenue (Q3 2025) | $1.17B (+8.9% YoY) |
| Net Income (Q3 2025) | $178.4M (+36% YoY) |
| Key Asset | Salar de Atacama (Chile) |
| Li Carbonate Capacity | 185,000 MT (expanding to 240,000 MT in 2026) |
| Li Hydroxide Capacity | 35,000 MT (expanding to 100,000 MT) |

**CORFO Partnership & Codelco JV:** The most consequential development for SQM is the formation of NovaAndino Litio SpA, a joint venture with state copper giant Codelco. Under this agreement:
- Codelco holds 50% + 1 share (majority control)
- The JV manages all lithium production in the Atacama from 2025 to 2060
- Between 2025-2030, the Chilean state receives approximately 70% of operating margin from new production
- From 2031 onward, the state receives 85% of operating margin from new production
- An additional 300,000 tonnes LCE of production is projected for 2025-2030

This JV fundamentally restructures the economics. SQM retains operational control and its low-cost production advantage, but the state captures the lion's share of economic rent. For investors, the question is whether SQM's increased volume (240,000 MT carbonate + 100,000 MT hydroxide) offsets the reduced margin retention.

**Cost Position:** SQM benefits from the highest-grade brine globally and decades of operational optimization. Cash costs are estimated at $3,500-4,500/tonne LCE, among the lowest in the industry. The Atacama's extreme aridity (less than 20mm annual rainfall) provides optimal evaporation conditions.

**Investment Thesis:** SQM offers the lowest-cost lithium production globally with massive scale. The Codelco JV provides resource security through 2060 but reduces per-tonne profitability. The company's diversification into potassium, iodine, and specialty plant nutrition provides earnings stability beyond lithium. Key risks include Chilean political/regulatory uncertainty, water rights disputes, and the unfavorable margin-sharing arrangement.

### 2.3 Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS)

**Profile:** Australia's largest independent hard rock lithium producer, operating the Pilgangoora mine in Western Australia.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | PLS (ASX) |
| Market Cap | ~A$12-14B (est. 2026) |
| FY2025 Production | 754,600 tonnes spodumene concentrate |
| FY2026 Guidance | 820,000-870,000 tonnes |
| FY2026 Unit Cost | A$560-600/tonne |
| FY2026 Capex | A$300-330M |
| Key Asset | Pilgangoora (Western Australia) |

**Operations & Expansion:** Pilbara Minerals completed its P1000 expansion in 2025, boosting quarterly production to 221,300 tonnes of spodumene concentrate in Q4 FY2025 — a 77% jump from the prior quarter. The company is now studying the P2000 expansion, which could lift production capacity to approximately 2 million tonnes per year. Scope and timing updates are expected by March 2026.

**BMX Auction Platform:** Pilbara Minerals operates the Battery Material Exchange (BMX), an innovative digital auction platform for spodumene concentrate. BMX provides price transparency and allows Pilbara to capture spot market premiums when prices spike. During the 2022 boom, BMX auctions achieved prices significantly above prevailing benchmarks.

**Investment Thesis:** Pilbara Minerals is a pure-play on spodumene concentrate with significant expansion optionality. The company's low-cost position ($560-600/tonne) provides margin protection in a downturn. With no downstream conversion assets, Pilbara avoids the capital intensity and execution risk of hydroxide plants, but also foregoes the value-added margin. The P2000 expansion represents a potential doubling of capacity, but timing depends on lithium price recovery. Key risks include concentrate pricing volatility, customer concentration (Chinese converters), and capex execution on P2000.

### 2.4 Arcadium Lithium / Rio Tinto Lithium

**Profile:** Arcadium Lithium was formed from the 2024 merger of Allkem and Livent, creating a diversified lithium producer with brine and hard rock assets. In March 2025, Rio Tinto completed its $6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium Lithium, forming Rio Tinto Lithium.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Acquirer | Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) |
| Acquisition Price | $6.7B ($5.85/share) |
| Completion Date | March 2025 |
| Key Assets | Salar de Hombre Muerto (Argentina brine), Mt Cattlin (AU hard rock), Rincon (Argentina), Bessemer City (US conversion) |
| Growth Target | 200,000+ tonnes LCE/year by 2028 |

**Merger Implications:** The Rio Tinto acquisition transforms the lithium landscape. Rio Tinto now holds one of the world's largest lithium resource bases and the financial muscle ($57B revenue, investment-grade balance sheet) to develop assets through the cycle regardless of short-term prices. The combined entity targets over 200,000 tonnes LCE annual capacity by 2028.

**Key Assets:**
- **Salar de Hombre Muerto (Argentina):** Large-scale brine operation with low production costs
- **Mt Cattlin (Western Australia):** Hard rock mine producing spodumene concentrate
- **Rincon (Argentina):** Greenfield brine project with significant DLE potential
- **Bessemer City (North Carolina):** Lithium hydroxide conversion facility

**Investment Thesis:** Lithium exposure through Rio Tinto offers a unique risk-reward profile. Investors get counter-cyclical development capability (Rio Tinto can invest through downturns when competitors cannot), diversified commodity exposure reducing lithium-specific risk, and a dividend-paying major miner. Arcadium's assets fill gaps in Rio Tinto's portfolio, particularly in battery-grade hydroxide for cathode manufacturers. The risk is that lithium remains a small portion of Rio Tinto's overall revenue, potentially limiting management attention.

### 2.5 Ganfeng Lithium (SHE: 002460 / HKG: 1772)

**Profile:** China's largest and most vertically integrated lithium company, spanning upstream mining through midstream chemical processing to downstream battery manufacturing and recycling.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | 002460 (Shenzhen) / 1772 (HK) |
| Revenue (TTM, Sep 2025) | ~$2.72B |
| Q3 2025 Revenue | RMB 6.25B (+44% YoY) |
| 2024 Production | 129,700 tonnes LCE (sales volume) |
| 2024 Capacity | 29,415 tonnes LCE (+31% YoY) |
| 2025 Net Profit Forecast | RMB 1.1-1.65B (vs. RMB 2.07B loss in 2024) |
| Global Production Bases | 11 |

**Global Investment Portfolio:**
- **Cauchari-Olaroz (Argentina):** JV with Lithium Americas, produced approximately 2,540 tonnes LCE in 2024 with production ramping to 3,000-3,500 tonnes in 2025
- **Goulamina (Mali):** Hard rock project targeting 300,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate in 2025
- **PPGS Salt Lake (China):** 15.07 million tonne LCE resource base, designed for 150,000 tonnes LCE annual capacity
- **Mt Marion (Australia):** JV with Mineral Resources

**Investment Thesis:** Ganfeng represents the Chinese integrated lithium model — controlling the supply chain from mine to battery to recycling. The company's return to profitability in 2025 (RMB 1.1-1.65B net profit vs. RMB 2.07B loss in 2024) demonstrates the leverage to lithium price recovery. Key risks include Chinese regulatory/geopolitical exposure, governance concerns typical of Chinese corporates, and resource nationalism risk in host countries (Argentina, Mali, Mexico).

### 2.6 Lithium Americas (NYSE/TSX: LAC)

**Profile:** A development-stage lithium company focused on the Thacker Pass project in northern Nevada — the largest known lithium deposit in the United States.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | LAC (NYSE/TSX) |
| Market Cap | ~$1.5-2B (est. 2026) |
| Key Asset | Thacker Pass (Nevada) |
| JV Structure | LAC 62% / GM 38% |
| Phase 1 Target | 40,000 tonnes LCE/year |
| Mechanical Completion | Late 2027 |
| First Production | 2028 |

**Thacker Pass Progress:** Construction is advancing with peak activity expected in 2026. As of September 2025, approximately 700 personnel were on site, expected to grow to 1,800 at peak construction. Major long-lead equipment deliveries are scheduled for Q1 2026. The project secured a $435M first draw from the DOE loan facility in Q4 2025.

**GM Partnership:** General Motors holds a 38% interest in the Thacker Pass JV and has a lithium offtake agreement. GM's involvement provides both capital and demand certainty — the offtake agreement guarantees a significant portion of Phase 1 production.

**Investment Thesis:** Thacker Pass is the most strategically important lithium project in the United States. The sedimentary clay deposit contains an enormous resource (estimated 13.7M tonnes LCE), and the project's location in Nevada provides proximity to the emerging US battery supply chain. The GM partnership de-risks both financing and offtake. However, LAC remains pre-revenue, the project has faced legal challenges from environmental groups and indigenous communities, and the clay-based extraction process is technically complex and unproven at commercial scale. The DOE loan facility reduces but does not eliminate financing risk.

### 2.7 Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL)

**Profile:** A US-focused lithium company with mining interests in North Carolina and Canada, and a planned hydroxide conversion facility in Tennessee.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ticker | PLL (NASDAQ) |
| Market Cap | ~$200-300M (est. 2026) |
| Key Projects | Carolina Lithium (NC mine), Tennessee Lithium (conversion), NAL (Quebec, JV) |
| NAL Q2 2025 Production | 58,533 dmt concentrate |
| Tennessee LiOH Target | 30,000 tonnes/year |
| Carolina LiOH Target | 30,000 tonnes/year |
| Combined US Target | 60,000 tonnes/year |

**Project Status:**
- **North American Lithium (NAL), Quebec:** JV with Sayona Quebec, currently producing spodumene concentrate. Q2 2025 output of 58,533 dry metric tonnes with 93% mill utilization and 73% lithium recovery. PLL has offtake rights to the greater of 50% of production or 113,000 dmt/year.
- **Carolina Lithium (North Carolina):** Integrated mining and processing project facing prolonged permitting delays due to local opposition. Capital expenditures under $1M/quarter as of Q3 2025, focused on permitting. Production unlikely before 2027 at earliest.
- **Tennessee Lithium:** Hydroxide conversion plant that received final permitting approval. Designed for 30,000 tonnes/year LiOH production using concentrate from NAL and Ghana. Estimated capital cost of approximately $800M.

**LG Chem Offtake:** PLL signed a strategic agreement with LG Chem for 200,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate (50,000 tonnes/year for 4 years) from NAL.

**Investment Thesis:** Piedmont offers leveraged upside to US domestic lithium supply buildout via IRA incentives. The combination of NAL production (generating near-term cash flow), Tennessee conversion (capturing downstream margin), and Carolina mining (long-term integrated supply) creates a compelling US lithium story. However, the stock carries significant execution risk — the Carolina project faces community opposition, Tennessee requires $800M in capital, and the company's small market cap limits financial flexibility. The NAL JV provides near-term production and cash flow, partially offsetting the pre-revenue nature of US projects.

## 3. Lithium Price Cycle

### 3.1 The Boom-Bust Cycle (2020-2026)

The lithium market has experienced one of the most dramatic commodity price cycles in modern history:

**2020-2022 Boom:** EV adoption accelerated faster than supply could respond. Chinese EV sales surged from 1.3M in 2020 to 6.9M in 2022. Lithium carbonate prices rose from approximately $6,000/tonne in early 2020 to a peak near $80,000/tonne in late 2022 — a 13x increase. The mania was amplified by downstream inventory building as battery makers scrambled to secure supply.

**2023-2024 Crash:** Prices collapsed as Chinese EV subsidies expired, destocking occurred across the supply chain, and massive new supply came online (particularly from Australian hard rock and Chinese lepidolite operations). By mid-2024, lithium carbonate prices had fallen below $10,000/tonne — an 85%+ decline from peak. Multiple projects became uneconomic, triggering mine curtailments and project deferrals across the industry.

**2025 Stabilization:** Prices bottomed around $10,000-11,000/tonne in early 2025, with Goldman Sachs estimating an average of $11,000/tonne. Supply response began — CATL and other Chinese producers paused operations, Australian marginal mines curtailed, and greenfield projects were shelved. EV demand continued growing despite the sentiment shift.

**2026 Recovery:** By early 2026, lithium carbonate and hydroxide prices surged above $20,000/tonne (per Fastmarkets CIF China, Japan, Korea assessments), with Chinese lithium carbonate futures reaching CNY 180,000/tonne in January 2026 before settling around CNY 160,000/tonne. The recovery has been driven by energy storage demand and tightening supply fundamentals.

### 3.2 Spot vs. Contract Pricing Dynamics

The lithium market features a complex pricing structure:

**Spot Market:** Dominated by Fastmarkets (formerly Metal Bulletin) and Asian Metal assessments. Spot pricing is highly volatile and influenced by Chinese speculative trading, short-term inventory dynamics, and sentiment. The introduction of lithium carbonate futures on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange (GFEX) in July 2023 added another layer of price discovery and speculation.

**Contract Pricing:** Major producers negotiate annual or multi-year supply agreements with fixed prices, price floors, or formula-based pricing (e.g., percentage of spot, cost-plus, or indexed to battery metal indices). Long-term contracts provide revenue stability for producers but can lag spot market moves in both directions.

**Pilbara BMX:** Pilbara Minerals' Battery Material Exchange provides a transparent spot auction mechanism for spodumene concentrate, serving as a de facto benchmark for hard rock pricing.

### 3.3 Forward Curve and Analyst Projections

Analyst consensus for 2026 lithium carbonate ranges from $12,000-17,000/tonne (Goldman Sachs at $13,250, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence at $15,000-17,000). However, the early 2026 spot price above $20,000/tonne suggests the market may be tighter than consensus expected.

**Supply-Demand Balance Forecasts:**
- **2025:** Fastmarkets projects a small surplus; S&P Global estimates a surplus of 141,000 MT LCE
- **2026:** Fastmarkets projects a deficit of 1,500 tonnes LCE; S&P Global expects the surplus to narrow to 109,000 MT LCE; Arcane Research suggests the market may flip to deficit
- **2027:** Wood Mackenzie forecasts a minor surplus

Global lithium chemical consumption is forecast to rise 13.5% year-over-year to 1.48 million MT LCE in 2026, while supply is expected to increase only 9.9% to 1.58 million MT LCE. The demand growth is increasingly driven by energy storage systems (BESS), with China's BESS segment expected to grow 40-60% in 2026.

### 3.4 Impact on Producer Margins and Project Economics

The price cycle has dramatically reshaped the competitive landscape:

**At $10,000/tonne (2024-early 2025):** Only the lowest-cost brine producers (SQM, Albemarle-Atacama) remained comfortably profitable. Most Australian spodumene operations were cash-flow negative at the mine gate or breakeven, and Chinese lepidolite operations were deeply unprofitable.

**At $20,000/tonne (early 2026):** Most brine and top-quartile hard rock producers are profitable. Albemarle guided 2025 average pricing at $9,500/tonne, implying significant margin expansion as 2026 pricing enters contracts. Pilbara Minerals at $560-600/tonne operating costs can generate healthy margins at current spodumene concentrate prices.

**Mine Curtailments and Supply Response:** Major Chinese mines including CATL-affiliated operations paused production during the downturn. Australian marginal operations curtailed. These shuttered mines represent latent supply that can restart if prices sustain above $15,000-18,000/tonne, creating a potential price ceiling. The speed of supply response is a key uncertainty — curtailed mines can restart in weeks to months, but deferred greenfield projects take years.

## 4. DLE Technology Deep Dive

### 4.1 Standard Lithium (NYSE: SLI)

**Technology:** LiSTR (Lithium Stirred Tank Reactor) process using proprietary solid sorbent media. The technology selectively adsorbs lithium from bromine-depleted brine produced by LANXESS at its south Arkansas facility.

**Phase 1A Project (LANXESS South Plant):**
- First production expected: 2026
- Average annual production: 5,400 tonnes LCE
- Peak annual production: 5,700 tonnes LCE
- Operating life: 25+ years
- Feedstock: Smackover brine from LANXESS operations

Standard Lithium's technology has been demonstrated at pilot scale over 3.5+ years and is currently the only DLE process in the industry positioned for near-term commercial scaling. LANXESS provides the brine supply and infrastructure, significantly de-risking the project.

**TETRA Technologies Partnership:** SLI exercised its option to acquire brine production rights for the South West Arkansas Project from TETRA Technologies, expanding its project portfolio beyond the LANXESS relationship.

**Investment Implications:** SLI offers first-mover advantage in commercial DLE. The LANXESS infrastructure and brine supply de-risk the project relative to greenfield DLE ventures. However, the company remains pre-revenue, and the transition from pilot to commercial scale is the critical risk. If Phase 1A delivers on time and on budget, it would validate DLE as commercially viable — a potential inflection point for the broader industry.

### 4.2 Lilac Solutions (Private)

**Technology:** Proprietary ion exchange media (IXM) that selectively captures lithium from brine. Lilac's Gen 5 technology achieved 87% lithium recovery on the Great Salt Lake's ultra-low-grade brine (69 mg/L lithium) during 2025 pilot operations — a concentration roughly 20x lower than Atacama brines.

**Commercial Progress:**
- **IXM Manufacturing (Fernley, Nevada):** Completed construction of commercial-scale manufacturing line in January 2026. Initial capacity of 200 tonnes IXM/year. Commissioning underway, production from mid-2026.
- **Great Salt Lake (Utah):** Commercial lithium facility in development. Phase 1 targets 2027 startup. A binding 10-year offtake agreement with Traxys covers 50,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate (5,000 tonnes/year). When operational, the facility will nearly double US lithium production.
- **Argentina (Jujuy):** Successful demonstration plant operations announced May 2025.
- **Germany:** Completed European pilot with Neptune Energy (geothermal brine) in December 2025.
- **Lake Resources (Australia):** Partnered on Kachi project in Argentina using Gen 4 DLE technology. Ford signed a 25,000 tonnes/year offtake agreement from this project.

**Investment Implications:** Lilac is private, limiting direct investment options. However, the company's commercial progress — particularly the IXM manufacturing line and Great Salt Lake offtake — suggests it may be closest to proving DLE at commercial scale. Watch for an IPO or SPAC transaction as the company approaches Phase 1 production. Strategic partnerships with oil/gas companies (Neptune Energy), commodity traders (Traxys), and automakers (Ford) provide validation and de-risking.

### 4.3 EnergyX (Private)

**Technology:** LiTAS (Lithium Ion Transport and Separation) platform combining three approaches:
- **AX (Adsorption):** Selective sorbent adsorption
- **SX (Solvent Extraction):** Proprietary reagents generating up to 60,000 ppm lithium concentration
- **MX (Membrane Separation):** Electrodialysis and selective bipolar electrodialysis

EnergyX claims 94%+ lithium recovery rates using a fraction of the freshwater of competitors.

**Funding and Partnerships:** GM Ventures led a $50M Series B in April 2023. The DOE awarded a $5M grant for geothermal brine extraction. POSCO is developing a $4B lithium project with rights to partner with EnergyX.

**Beyond Lithium:** EnergyX has expanded into nuclear isotope separation, initiating nuclear-grade testing in 2025 with an integrated isotope separation pilot planned for 2026.

**Investment Implications:** EnergyX is earlier-stage than Standard Lithium or Lilac, with more technology risk but broader potential applications. The GM and POSCO backing provide validation. The nuclear pivot is intriguing but adds complexity and could dilute focus on lithium. Private company — watch for future capital raises or IPO.

### 4.4 DLE Industry Outlook

The DLE market is projected to grow significantly, with IDTechEx forecasting substantial adoption between 2026-2036. The technology's advantages are compelling: higher recovery rates, lower environmental impact, faster processing, and the ability to unlock unconventional lithium sources. However, the industry must demonstrate sustained commercial-scale production, prove long-term sorbent/membrane durability, and achieve cost competitiveness with conventional extraction.

If DLE succeeds at scale, it could fundamentally reshape lithium supply geography by enabling production from oilfield brines (US, Germany), geothermal brines (California's Salton Sea, Italy), and low-grade continental brines (Utah's Great Salt Lake). This would reduce dependence on the Lithium Triangle and Australia, enhancing supply chain resilience for Western battery manufacturers.

## 5. Lithium Recycling

### 5.1 Market Overview

The global lithium-ion battery recycling market was valued at approximately $8.7-13B in 2025 (estimates vary by methodology) and is projected to grow at 20%+ CAGR through 2035, reaching $47-114B depending on the forecast. The market is being driven by:

- **Regulatory mandates:** EU Battery Regulation requires minimum recycled content (16% cobalt, 6% lithium, 6% nickel by 2031). China and individual US states are implementing collection and recycling requirements.
- **Feedstock availability:** The first wave of EV batteries from 2012-2015 is reaching end-of-life, and manufacturing scrap from new battery gigafactories provides near-term feedstock.
- **Economics:** Recycled battery materials are approaching cost parity with mined virgin materials, particularly for cobalt and nickel. Lithium recovery has improved but remains economically marginal at low lithium prices.

**Recovery Rates:** Modern hydrometallurgical processes enable over 90% recovery of lithium, cobalt, and nickel from battery black mass. However, actual global lithium recovery from all applications remains only 1-3% — reflecting the enormous gap between technical capability and deployed recycling infrastructure.

### 5.2 Li-Cycle (formerly LICY) / Glencore

**History:** Li-Cycle pioneered the Spoke & Hub model for lithium-ion battery recycling. Spoke facilities across North America mechanically process batteries and manufacturing scrap into "black mass" — a fine powder containing lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese. The black mass is then shipped to a Hub facility for hydrometallurgical processing into battery-grade materials.

**Rochester Hub Saga:** Li-Cycle began constructing its flagship Rochester Hub at Eastman Business Park in Rochester, New York in early 2022, initially budgeted at $560M. Costs ballooned to nearly $1B, and the company paused construction in October 2023. Li-Cycle secured a $475M DOE loan facility in November 2024 to support project completion.

**Glencore Acquisition:** Glencore acquired Li-Cycle effective August 8, 2025, bringing the deep-pocketed commodity trader's balance sheet and operational expertise. Glencore's GBR HubCo intends to restart and complete the Rochester Hub, advancing recovery of lithium, nickel, and cobalt from recycled batteries. The original capacity target was 35,000 metric tons of black mass annually.

**Investment Implications:** Li-Cycle's technology is proven at Spoke scale, and the Rochester Hub represents the critical test of commercial hydrometallurgical recycling in North America. Glencore's involvement dramatically de-risks the project financially. However, execution and cost overrun risk remains. Investors seeking recycling exposure now access it through Glencore (LON: GLEN), a diversified commodity major.

### 5.3 Redwood Materials (Private)

**Profile:** Founded by former Tesla CTO and co-founder JB Straubel, Redwood Materials has rapidly become the dominant lithium-ion battery recycler in North America.

**Scale:**
- Controls approximately 70-90% of lithium-ion battery recycling in North America (estimates vary)
- Processes roughly 20-25 GWh of battery material annually, equivalent to approximately 250,000 EV batteries
- 2025 target: 100 GWh capacity (enough for 1 million EVs)
- 2030 target: 500 GWh capacity

**Operations:**
- **Nevada Campus:** Original facility near Tesla's Gigafactory. Produces anode copper foil and cathode active materials from recycled battery materials.
- **South Carolina Plant:** New $3.5B, 600-acre facility. Critical materials recovery began November 2025. This mega-facility positions Redwood as an integrated battery materials supplier, not just a recycler.

**Funding:** Closed a $350M Series E in October 2025 (later upsized to $425M), bringing total funding to over $2B. Investors include Goldman Sachs, Baillie Gifford, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price.

**Product Strategy:** Redwood is not merely recycling — it is building a circular battery materials supply chain. The company produces battery-grade copper foil (anode) and cathode active materials (NMC, LFP) from a combination of recycled batteries, manufacturing scrap, and raw materials. This positions Redwood as a direct supplier to battery cell manufacturers, competing with traditional mining and chemical companies.

**Investment Implications:** Redwood is the clear market leader in North American battery recycling with unmatched scale, technology, and strategic relationships (Tesla, Panasonic, Toyota, Ford). The company is private with a reported valuation exceeding $5B, making it accessible primarily through private market funds. An IPO would be a major event for the battery materials sector. Key risks include dependence on battery feedstock availability (limited end-of-life EVs through 2028), capital intensity of the South Carolina build-out, and potential for over-investment ahead of feedstock availability.

### 5.4 Recycling Economics and Circular Economy Projections

**Current Economics:** Battery recycling is economically attractive for cobalt and nickel recovery due to their high value. Lithium recovery adds marginal value at current prices but becomes significantly more attractive above $15,000-20,000/tonne. As lithium prices recover and regulatory mandates take effect, recycling economics improve substantially.

**Feedstock Timeline:** The recycling industry faces a temporal mismatch — massive investments are being made now, but the large wave of end-of-life EV batteries will not arrive until 2028-2032. In the interim, manufacturing scrap from battery gigafactories provides the primary feedstock. This is a feature, not a bug — companies like Redwood are building capabilities and customer relationships now to capture the massive end-of-life wave.

**Circular Economy Impact:** By 2040, recycled lithium could supply 15-25% of total lithium demand, reducing dependence on primary mining. The EU's mandated recycled content requirements will create a regulatory floor for recycled material demand. Long-term projections suggest recycled materials could save over $1T globally and meaningfully reduce battery material prices.
