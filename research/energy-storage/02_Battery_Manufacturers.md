# Battery Manufacturers: The Global Race for Energy Storage Dominance

## Executive Summary

The global EV battery market reached 1,187 GWh of installations in 2025, a 31.7% year-over-year increase, with Chinese manufacturers consolidating dominance. CATL and BYD together command 55.6% of global market share while Korean manufacturers' combined share slipped to 16.0%, down 3.5 percentage points year-over-year. The US manufacturing buildout, catalyzed by IRA Section 45X credits ($35/kWh cell, $10/kWh module), has driven over 1 TWh of announced gigafactory capacity, but political headwinds and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions are reshaping project timelines. Battery pack prices hit a record low of $108/kWh in 2025, with LFP packs averaging $81/kWh vs. $128/kWh for NMC -- and LFP has now overtaken nickel-based chemistries as the dominant global chemistry at ~60% market share. Solid-state batteries remain 2-5 years from commercialization, with QuantumScape's QSE-5 Eagle Line pilot inaugurating in February 2026 and Toyota targeting 2027-2028.

## 5. IRA 45X Manufacturing Credits

### 5.1 Credit Structure

The Inflation Reduction Act Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit provides:
- **$35/kWh** for battery cell production in the US
- **$10/kWh** for battery module/pack assembly in the US
- **$45/kWh total** for integrated cell + module production
- Additional credits for critical mineral processing and electrode active material production

At a typical 60 kWh EV battery pack, this translates to **$2,700 per vehicle** in production credits -- a transformative subsidy that fundamentally changes US manufacturing economics.

### 5.2 FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) Restrictions

The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA), enacted in July 2025, significantly tightened FEOC restrictions on 45X credits:

**Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFEs):** Companies headquartered in, or with 25%+ ownership/board control by entities in, China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea cannot claim 45X credits.

**Material Assistance Cost Ratio (MACR):**
- Starting tax years after July 4, 2025: Taxpayers cannot be PFEs or receive material assistance from PFEs
- 2026 threshold: 60% of component value must come from non-PFE sources
- 2029+ threshold: 85% from non-PFE sources
- Grandfathering: Contracts finalized before June 16, 2025 are exempt if components are placed in service before January 1, 2030

**Compliance Challenges:**
- Treasury must establish "safe harbor tables" by December 31, 2026
- 20% accuracy-related penalty for MACR overstatement
- 6-year IRS audit window for MACR deficiencies
- Many cathode/anode materials still predominantly sourced from China, making compliance difficult

### 5.3 Impact on US Manufacturing Economics

**Biggest Beneficiaries:**
| Company | Benefit Mechanism | Estimated Annual 45X Value |
|---|---|---|
| Panasonic (Kansas/Nevada) | Full cell production credit | $1.5-2.5B at full capacity |
| LG Energy Solution (US plants) | Cell + module credits | $2-3B at full capacity |
| Tesla (Nevada in-house) | Cell production + integration | $1-2B at 100 GWh |
| SK On (GA, TN) | Cell production credit | $1-1.5B at full capacity |
| Samsung SDI/Stellantis (IN) | Cell production credit | $1-1.5B at full capacity |

**Without 45X credits**, US-manufactured cells are estimated to cost 30-40% more than Chinese imports. With credits, they approach parity, making the subsidy critical to the domestic buildout's economic viability.

**Political Risk:** The OBBBA modifications demonstrate that credit terms can change. Companies making multi-billion-dollar, decade-long investments face regulatory uncertainty. The grandfathering provisions provide some protection but do not eliminate risk.

## 6. Battery Cost Curves

### 6.1 Historical Price Trajectory

| Year | Average Pack Price ($/kWh) | Key Driver |
|---|---|---|
| 2013 | $780 | Early commercialization |
| 2016 | $300 | Scale-up, NMC transition |
| 2019 | $161 | Manufacturing optimization |
| 2022 | $151 | Lithium price spike (temporary reversal) |
| 2023 | $139 | Lithium crash, LFP adoption |
| 2024 | $117 | Overcapacity, competition |
| 2025 | $108 | Record low, LFP dominance |
| 2026E | $95-100 | Continued LFP shift, scale |
| 2028E | $80-85 | Sodium-ion contribution, manufacturing advances |

### 6.2 Pack vs. Cell Level Costs

In 2025, cell-level costs averaged approximately $75/kWh, while pack-level costs reached $108/kWh. The ~$33/kWh gap represents:
- Battery management system (BMS)
- Thermal management (cooling/heating)
- Structural enclosure and mounting
- Wiring, connectors, safety systems
- Manufacturing/assembly margin

Cell-to-pack (CTP) and cell-to-body (CTB) architectures from CATL and BYD are compressing this gap by eliminating module-level packaging, potentially saving $5-15/kWh.

### 6.3 LFP vs. NMC Cost Comparison (2025)

| Metric | LFP Pack | NMC Pack | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average Pack Price | $81/kWh | $128/kWh | LFP 37% cheaper |
| Cell Cost | ~$53/kWh | ~$85/kWh | LFP 38% cheaper |
| Raw Material Cost Share | ~35% | ~55% | LFP less exposed |
| Key Cost Driver | Iron, phosphate (cheap) | Nickel, cobalt (volatile) | LFP more stable |

### 6.4 Regional Price Disparities (2025)

| Region | Average Pack Price ($/kWh) | Premium vs. China |
|---|---|---|
| China | $84 | Baseline |
| Global Average | $108 | +29% |
| North America | ~$121 | +44% |
| Europe | ~$131 | +56% |

China's cost advantage stems from: vertically integrated supply chains, massive manufacturing scale, lower labor costs, proximity to critical mineral processing, and intense domestic competition driving innovation.

### 6.5 Raw Material Impact

Battery costs remain exposed to upstream commodity volatility:
- **Lithium carbonate:** Crashed from ~$80,000/tonne (Nov 2022) to ~$10,000/tonne (2024-2025), driving much of the recent cost decline
- **Nickel:** Relatively stable at $15,000-18,000/tonne but Indonesian supply dominance creates concentration risk
- **Cobalt:** Declining importance as high-nickel and LFP chemistries reduce/eliminate cobalt
- **Graphite:** 70%+ processed in China, creating FEOC compliance challenges for US manufacturers

Despite rising lithium and cobalt metal costs in 2025, cell manufacturing overcapacity, fierce competition, and LFP adoption more than offset material price increases, pushing pack prices to record lows.

### 6.6 Manufacturing Scale Effects

The battery industry exhibits strong learning-rate dynamics:
- Historical learning rate: ~18-20% cost reduction per doubling of cumulative production
- CATL's scale (400+ GWh/year) provides 15-20% cost advantage over smaller producers
- Minimum efficient scale for a competitive cell plant: ~30-40 GWh/year
- Below 10 GWh/year, unit economics are typically unviable without subsidies

## Outlook & Key Themes for 2026-2028

1. **LFP Dominance Accelerates:** LFP will continue gaining share globally, driven by cost advantage, improving energy density, and major OEM adoption. Sodium-ion enters as the ultra-low-cost option beneath LFP.

2. **US Manufacturing Reality Check:** The IRA-catalyzed buildout faces headwinds from FEOC compliance complexity, slower Western EV demand, and political uncertainty. Several plants face delays or retooling (Ultium Spring Hill, Panasonic Kansas, BlueOval Kentucky).

3. **Solid-State Inflection Point:** 2026-2027 will determine whether solid-state batteries can cross from pilot to commercial production. QuantumScape's Eagle Line and Toyota's sulfide cells are the nearest-term bellwethers.

4. **Chinese Supply Chain Lock-In:** Despite FEOC restrictions, China controls 70%+ of global battery material processing. Even US-manufactured cells depend heavily on Chinese cathode/anode materials, creating a structural vulnerability that will take 5-10 years to meaningfully diversify.

5. **ESS Becomes the Growth Engine:** With stationary storage pack prices hitting $70/kWh in 2025 (45% below 2024), battery energy storage is experiencing explosive growth. LG, CATL, BYD, and Tesla are all pivoting significant capacity toward grid storage.

6. **Cost Parity Below $100/kWh:** The industry is on track to break the symbolic $100/kWh pack-level barrier in 2026, a threshold long considered necessary for EVs to achieve unsubsidized cost parity with ICE vehicles.
