## 1. Space Tourism

### Market Size Projections
- **2025:** ~$1.3B (estimates range $1.26-1.36B)
- **2030:** $2.7-10.1B depending on methodology (wide range reflects uncertainty)
- **CAGR:** 17-45% depending on source; orbital segment fastest at ~45% CAGR
- Key driver: price reduction over time as vehicle reuse matures

### Virgin Galactic (SPCE) -- Suborbital
- **Status:** No commercial flights since mid-2023 pause; building Delta-class SpaceShip
- **Timeline:** Research payload flights summer 2026, private astronaut flights fall 2026, bulk customer flights 2027+
- **Financials (Q3 2025):** Revenue $0.4M (access fees only), cash burn ~$100M/quarter, capex $156M YTD
- **Cash position:** $424M (as of Sept 30, 2025) -- ~4 quarters of runway at current burn
- **Ticket pricing:** Expected above $600K when sales reopen Q1 2026; sold in tranches
- **Flight capacity target:** 1 flight/week ramping to 3/week; ~125 flights/year capability
- **Stock:** ~$2.35 (Feb 2026), down 99%+ from 2021 ATH of ~$1,200 (split-adjusted)
- **Risk:** Enormous execution risk; zero revenue vehicle, cash burn, unproven Delta-class

### Blue Origin New Shepard -- Suborbital
- **Status:** PAUSED as of January 30, 2026 -- at least 2 years
- **Reason:** Resources redirected to Blue Moon lunar lander (Artemis program)
- **Track record:** 38 flights total, 17 crewed, 98 passengers to Karman line
- **Last flight:** NS-38 (Jan 22, 2026), six passengers
- **Notable:** NS-31 (April 2025) all-female crew including Katy Perry
- **Impact:** Suborbital tourism effectively has zero active providers until VG returns in late 2026

### SpaceX Private Missions -- Orbital
- **Polaris Dawn (Sept 2024):** First private spacewalk; crew of 4 reached 1,400km altitude
- **Polaris Program:** 3 planned missions, funded by Jared Isaacman (Shift4 CEO)
- **dearMoon:** Cancelled June 2024 due to Starship delays (Yusaku Maezawa's lunar flyby)
- **Axiom missions:** SpaceX provides Dragon transport for Axiom private ISS missions (Ax-1 through Ax-4 completed)

### Space Perspective -- Near-Space Balloon
- **Status:** Original company shut down early 2025; acquired by Eos X Space
- **Product:** Stratospheric balloon to 100,000ft (30km), 6-hour flight, 2hrs at altitude
- **Ticket price:** $125,000 (much more accessible than suborbital)
- **Reservations:** 1,800+ ticket holders, first year sold out
- **Timeline:** Crewed tests 2025, commercial flights late 2025/early 2026
- **Caveat:** Not true "space" (Karman line is 100km); more comparable to extreme tourism

### Investment Takeaway
Space tourism remains pre-revenue for most players. VG is the only public pure-play but carries extreme execution risk and dilution risk. The 2-year Blue Origin pause removes the only proven suborbital competitor. Near-term revenue generation: late 2026 at earliest (VG) or 2027 more realistically.

## 2. Commercial Space Stations

### ISS Retirement Timeline
- **Operations through:** End of 2030
- **Deorbit:** January 2031 splashdown
- **SpaceX deorbit vehicle:** $843M contract; modified Dragon with 6x propellant, 4x thruster power, 46 Draco thrusters
- **Vehicle delivery:** 2028 target
- **Budget risk:** Trump FY2026 proposal cuts NASA 24% ($6B); may cancel SLS/Orion after Artemis III and Lunar Gateway

### Vast -- Haven-1 (Private, Jed McCaleb-founded)
- **Timeline:** Launch May 2026 (some sources say Q1 2027); first crew (Vast-1) June 2026
- **Capacity:** 4 crew for up to 10 days; single-module station
- **Haven-2:** Multi-module station launching via Starship in 2028 (pending NASA CLD Phase 2)
- **Funding:** $150M+ raised; investors include In-Q-Tel
- **Status:** Primary structure completed July 2025; structural testing done Nov 2025
- **FIRST to launch** among commercial station competitors

### Axiom Space (Private)
- **Timeline:** PPTM (first module) launch NET 2027 (revised from 2026); ISS docking then separation in 2028
- **Full station:** Free-flying by 2030 (before ISS deorbit); additional modules after separation
- **Missions:** Ax-4 completed 2025 (India, Poland, Hungary crews)
- **Valuation:** ~$2B (March 2025 round); down from $2.6B Series C in 2023
- **Total funding:** $605M+; additional $100M from Hungary's 4iG (Dec 2025) for orbital data center
- **Financial concerns:** Late 2024 reports of ~100 layoffs, voluntary 20% pay cuts, contractor payment issues
- **NASA CLD award:** Selected for Phase 1; Phase 2 awards expected early 2026

### Starlab (Voyager Space / Airbus / MDA)
- **Timeline:** Launch 2028 via Starship
- **Status:** "Full-scale development" phase entered
- **Capacity:** 4 astronauts, external robotic arm
- **Design:** Single-launch deployment on Starship

### Orbital Reef (Blue Origin / Sierra Space / Boeing)
- **Timeline:** Behind schedule; Preliminary Design Review still incomplete as of mid-2025
- **Status:** Trailing Starlab and Axiom; no firm launch date
- **Risk:** Blue Origin resource diversion to Blue Moon lander may further delay

### NASA CLD Program
- Phase 2 Announcement for Proposals: late 2025
- Phase 2 funded Space Act Agreements: early 2026
- Critical for Haven-2, Starlab, and Orbital Reef funding

### Investment Takeaway
Vast is the dark horse leader -- first to potentially launch (2026), lean team, Starship-aligned for Haven-2. Axiom has the strongest government relationships but financial strain is concerning. All are private market. The 2028-2031 ISS transition creates a structural demand gap that these stations must fill. If ISS deorbits before commercial stations are ready, there will be a gap in human LEO presence -- a scenario NASA is working hard to avoid.

## 3. Lunar Economy

### Artemis Program Status
- **Artemis II:** NET March 6, 2026 -- crewed flyby (no landing); SLS rolled to pad Jan 18, 2026
- **Artemis III:** Delayed to NET 2028 (was 2027, was 2026); heat shield issues + Starship delays
  - May fly without crewed landing; could become Gateway visit instead
- **Budget threat:** Trump FY2026 proposal would cancel SLS/Orion after Artemis III and cancel Lunar Gateway
  - $1B allocated directly to SpaceX in proposal
- **Implication:** Lunar program may pivot to fully commercial (SpaceX-centric) architecture

### CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services)
- **2025 successes:** Firefly Blue Ghost (landed March 2) and Intuitive Machines IM-2 (landed March 6)
- **Upcoming:** Blue Origin VIPER delivery (late 2027), Firefly next flight (2030)
- **Model:** NASA buys payload delivery as a service; enables commercial lander companies

### Intuitive Machines (LUNR) -- Public
- **Stock price:** ~$21.58 (Jan 2026)
- **Revenue:** ~$275M FY2025 (low end guidance); consensus $919M in 2026
- **Lanteris acquisition:** $800M deal completed; combined entity >$850M revenue, positive adj. EBITDA, $920M backlog
- **Missions:** Two successful lunar landings (2024 and 2025)
- **Positive EBITDA:** Expected 2026
- **SPAC performance:** IPO at $10, spiked to ~$82 first week, crashed to ~$2 by early 2024, recovered to $21+ by 2026
- **Thesis:** Only profitable (soon) public lunar company; strong government contract pipeline

### Astrobotic (Private)
- **Track record:** First Peregrine lander failed (crashed back to Earth, 2024)
- **Next:** Griffin lander scheduled July 2026 (VIPER rover delivery)
- **Risk:** Execution credibility damaged by Peregrine failure

### ispace (Japan, TYO: 9348)
- **Mission 2 (RESILIENCE):** Launched Jan 2025, crash-landed June 2025 (Laser Range Finder anomaly)
- **Mission 3 (APEX 1.0):** Led by ispace-U.S., expected launch 2026
- **Mission 4 (Series 3):** Japan-based, launch by 2027
- **Track record:** 0 for 2 on landings; execution risk remains high

### Lunar Gateway
- **Status:** Under threat from FY2026 budget proposal (cancellation proposed)
- **Original plan:** Orbiting lunar outpost for sustained exploration
- **If cancelled:** Eliminates a major infrastructure element of the Artemis architecture

### Investment Takeaway
LUNR is the standout public investment in the lunar economy -- real revenue, growing backlog, and the only company with two successful commercial lunar landings. The Artemis budget fight creates both risk (program cuts) and opportunity (commercial providers like SpaceX/LUNR benefit from privatization trend). The lunar economy is real but early-stage; revenue is almost entirely government contracts.

## 4. In-Space Manufacturing

### Varda Space Industries (Private)
- **Focus:** Microgravity pharmaceutical crystallization
- **Milestone:** First corporate re-entry from orbit (Feb 2024) -- ritonavir crystals (HIV drug)
- **Missions:** 4 completed (W-1 through W-4), W-5 expected by end of 2025
- **2026 plan:** 6 missions; targeting monthly launch cadence
- **Expansion:** Biologics API manufacturing (monoclonal antibodies) starting 2026
- **Funding:** $329M total raised; $187M Series C (July 2025) led by Natural Capital and Shrug Capital
- **Facilities:** New 10,000 sqft lab in El Segundo; office in Huntsville, AL
- **Thesis:** Closest to proving space manufacturing business model; pharmaceuticals are highest-value use case

### Redwire Corporation (RDW) -- Public
- **Stock:** ~$10 (Feb 2026); 52-week range $4.87-$26.66
- **Revenue guidance:** $320-340M FY2025; gross margins 27-30%
- **Backlog:** $355.6M
- **Products:** ZBLAN fiber optics, microgravity payloads, spacecraft platforms, UAS (drones)
- **ZBLAN progress:** Record 3,700ft fiber drawn in one day; partnered with Thorlabs for industrialization
- **Challenge:** Stock down 55% from Feb 2025 highs; Q3 earnings underwhelming
- **2026 outlook:** Analysts bullish (Buy consensus, $13 target); Blue UAS drones + new Michigan facility

### ZBLAN Fiber Optics
- **What:** Fluoride glass fiber with superior transmission properties vs. silica
- **Why space:** Earth gravity causes micro-crystallization defects; microgravity eliminates this
- **Status:** Commercial quantities now producible in space (700m+ draws demonstrated)
- **Market:** Specialty fiber optics for telecommunications, medical lasers, sensing
- **Challenge:** Must scale production economics to justify space manufacturing costs

### Investment Takeaway
In-space manufacturing is the sleeper sector. Varda is the most exciting private company -- proven re-entry capability, pharmaceutical focus, and ramping mission cadence. Redwire is the public play but is a conglomerate (drones, sensors, space hardware) rather than a pure ISM play. Revenue timeline: Varda likely generating meaningful pharmaceutical revenue by 2027-2028; Redwire already revenue-generating but ISM is a small portion.

## 6. Space SPAC Performance History

### Summary Table

| Company | Ticker | SPAC Year | ATH | Current (Feb 2026) | From ATH | Status |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----|---------------------|----------|--------|
| Virgin Galactic | SPCE | 2019 | ~$1,200* | $2.35 | -99.8% | Active, pre-revenue |
| Astra Space | ASTR | 2021 | ~$17 | $0.54 | -96.8% | Delisted/taken private |
| Momentus | MNTS | 2021 | ~$28 | $12.86** | -54% | Reverse split, Nasdaq delisting notice |
| Spire Global | SPIR | 2021 | ~$22 | $11.45 | -48% | Improving; divested maritime |
| Planet Labs | PL | 2021 | ~$13 | $28.78 | +121% | **Winner**: near ATH |
| BlackSky | BKSY | 2021 | ~$33 | $20.99 | -36% | Recovering; Strong Buy consensus |
| Satellogic | SATL | 2022 | ~$11 | $3.67 | -67% | Volatile; up 88% in Jan 2026 |
| Redwire | RDW | 2021 | $26.66 | $10.00 | -62% | Solid backlog; Buy consensus |
| Intuitive Machines | LUNR | 2023 | ~$82 | $21.58 | -74% | **Best turnaround**: lunar revenue growing |

*Split-adjusted. **Post 1:17.85 reverse split.

### Key Observations
1. **Catastrophic losses are the norm:** Most space SPACs lost 50-99% from highs
2. **Planet Labs is the only clear SPAC winner** -- trading at ATH with real, growing revenue
3. **LUNR is the best turnaround story** -- from $2 to $21+ on actual lunar mission success
4. **Astra and Momentus effectively failed** -- delisted/near-delisted
5. **The SPAC structure itself was the problem:** Companies went public too early with no revenue, creating inevitable sell pressure as lockups expired and revenue projections were missed
6. **Survivors are now being valued on fundamentals** rather than hype -- Planet, BlackSky, and LUNR trade on actual revenue/contracts

### Investment Takeaway
The space SPAC class of 2021 was largely a disaster for investors, with the average SPAC losing ~65% from highs. However, the companies with real products and growing government contracts (Planet, LUNR, BlackSky) have recovered significantly. The lesson: avoid pre-revenue space SPACs; wait for fundamental proof points.

## 7. Private Market / VC

### SpaceX -- The Dominant Force
- **Valuation trajectory:**
  - Dec 2024: $350B (employee share buyback)
  - Jul 2025: ~$400B (insider share sale)
  - Dec 2025: $800B (secondary share sale)
  - Mid-2026 target: **$1.5T IPO** (seeking to raise ~$50B)
- **Financial performance (2025):** ~$8B profit on $15-16B revenue (estimated)
- **xAI merger:** SpaceX acquiring Musk's AI startup xAI ahead of potential IPO
- **Access:** Secondary market shares, pre-IPO funds, or eventual IPO

### Other Notable Private Companies

| Company | Last Known Valuation | Total Raised | Status |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|--------|
| SpaceX | $800B (Dec 2025) | $10B+ | IPO targeting mid-2026 at $1.5T |
| Axiom Space | $2B (Mar 2025) | $605M+ | Financial strain; module delays |
| Relativity Space | ~$4.2B (2023) | $2.4B+ | Eric Schmidt now CEO; Terran R late 2026 |
| Varda Space | Undisclosed | $329M | Series C closed Jul 2025 |
| Vast Space | Undisclosed | $150M+ | Haven-1 launch 2026 |

### Relativity Space
- **CEO change:** Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO) took over March 2025, making significant personal investment
- **Terran R:** First flight late 2026; CDR completed Dec 2024
- **Contracts:** $2.9B+ in launch service agreements (SES, government, telecom)
- **Risk:** Previous vehicle (Terran 1) retired without commercial success; pivoted entirely to Terran R

### Space VC Funding Trends

| Year | Total Space VC | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| 2022 | ~$8B | Peak SPAC/VC era |
| 2023 | ~$6.2B | Down year; macro tightening |
| 2024 | ~$9.1-9.5B | Strong recovery; 99 companies funded |
| 2025 Q1 | ~$1.6B | On pace for another strong year |
| 2000-2022 cumulative | $60B+ | Total startup space investment |

- **Key trend:** After 2023 pullback, VC investment rebounded strongly in 2024, driven by reduced launch costs (reusable rockets), satellite constellations, and dual-use defense tech
- **Hot areas:** In-space manufacturing (Varda), satellite direct-to-cell (AST SpaceMobile), commercial stations, lunar services

### Investment Takeaway
SpaceX's potential mid-2026 IPO at $1.5T would be the most significant space investment event in history. It would create a new megacap and likely pull up valuations across the sector. For private market access, Varda and Vast are the most interesting growth-stage companies. VC funding is healthy and growing, indicating continued private sector confidence. The Eric Schmidt/Relativity bet is notable -- a top Silicon Valley figure putting personal capital into rockets suggests conviction in the commercial launch market.

## 8. Asteroid Mining & Space Resources

### AstroForge (Private)
- **Mission 1 (Brokkr-1, 2023):** Cubesat test; partial success
- **Mission 2 (Odin, Feb 2025):** Lost contact after launch on Falcon 9; $6.5M spacecraft lost
- **Mission 3 (Vestri):** Planned 2026, rideshare on Intuitive Machines IM-3; would attempt first private asteroid landing
- **Focus:** Platinum-group metals (PGMs) from near-Earth asteroids
- **Funding:** ~$13M raised (seed-stage)
- **Risk:** Very early; two missions with limited success; high technical difficulty

### TransAstra (Private)
- **Approach:** Giant inflatable "Capture Bag" (kevlar/aluminum) to grab small asteroids
- **Target asteroids:** 15-50ft diameter, Earth-like orbits
- **First retrieval target:** 2028
- **Assets:** Ground-based telescope network for asteroid discovery
- **NASA funding:** Received NASA grants for technology development
- **Stage:** Pre-mission; technology development phase

### Lessons from Planetary Resources
- Founded 2009 by Peter Diamandis, backed by Google founders, James Cameron
- Raised $50M+, built satellite prototypes
- Pivoted to Earth observation, acquired by ConsenSys (blockchain) in 2018
- **Lesson:** Asteroid mining economics don't work yet -- the cost to reach, extract, and return materials far exceeds terrestrial mining costs for most materials
- **Exception:** In-space utilization (water for fuel, regolith for construction) may be viable before return-to-Earth mining

### Regulatory Framework
- **U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (2015):** Grants U.S. citizens property rights over space resources they extract
- **Artemis Accords:** Multilateral framework supporting space resource utilization; 40+ signatory nations
- **Luxembourg Space Resources Act (2017):** First European space mining framework
- **UN Outer Space Treaty (1967):** Prohibits national sovereignty claims but silent on resource extraction
- **Status:** Legal framework exists but untested; no commercial extraction has occurred

### Investment Takeaway
Asteroid mining is a 2030s+ opportunity at the earliest. Current companies are seed/early-stage with unproven technology. The Planetary Resources failure demonstrates that the economics don't yet support return-to-Earth mining. The nearer-term opportunity is in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) on the Moon -- using lunar ice/regolith for propellant and construction -- which feeds into the Artemis/CLPS ecosystem. AstroForge is the most active company but has had mixed results. This sector is venture-stage speculation, not investment-grade.
