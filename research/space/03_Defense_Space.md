## 1. US Space Force Budget Trends (FY2020-FY2026)

| Fiscal Year | Request ($B) | Enacted ($B) | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| FY2020 | N/A | N/A | USSF created Dec 2019; no separate budget line |
| FY2021 | $15.4 | ~$15.4 | First standalone USSF budget; reshuffled from Air Force |
| FY2022 | $17.4 | $18.1 | Congress added ~$700M above request |
| FY2023 | $24.5 | $26.3 | Major jump; Congress added $1.8B |
| FY2024 | $30.0 | ~$28.7 | Trimmed by Fiscal Responsibility Act caps |
| FY2025 | $29.4 | $28.9 | Slight decline from FY2024 request |
| FY2026 | $26.3 (base) / $40.1 (with reconciliation) | TBD | +38% vs FY2025 when reconciliation included |

**Key Takeaway:** USSF base budget grew from ~$15B to ~$29B in five years (roughly doubled). FY2026 represents a step-change if reconciliation funds ($13.8B for Golden Dome) are included, bringing the total to ~$40B.

### FY2026 Budget Drivers
- **Golden Dome missile defense:** $24.4B in reconciliation + $13.4B in defense appropriations
- **SDA constellation deployment:** Tranche 1 launches continuing, Tranche 3 contracts awarded
- **Next-Gen OPIR:** First GEO satellite delivery and launch
- **Space domain awareness** and defensive operations funding increases

## 2. Space Development Agency (SDA) & PWSA

### Architecture Overview

The Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) is a multi-layered LEO constellation designed to provide:
- **Transport Layer:** Mesh data relay network (optical inter-satellite links)
- **Tracking Layer:** Missile warning/tracking with IR sensors
- **Custody Layer:** Target tracking for fire-control solutions
- **Navigation Layer:** Alternative PNT backup to GPS

### Deployment Timeline

| Tranche | Status | Satellites | Launch Window | Capability |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Tranche 0** | Operational | 28 | 2023-2024 | Demo/pathfinder |
| **Tranche 1** | Launching | ~150 | Sep 2025 - 2027 | Initial warfighting capability (2027) |
| **Tranche 2** | Building | 254 | Late 2026 - 2028 | Full operational constellation |
| **Tranche 3** | Contracted | 72+ (Tracking) | FY2029 | Near-continuous global missile tracking |

### Major SDA Contract Awards (2024-2026)

**Tranche 3 Tracking Layer (Dec 2025) -- $3.5B total:**

| Contractor | Satellites | Value |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Lockheed Martin | 18 | ~$1.0B |
| L3Harris | 18 | $843M |
| Rocket Lab | 18 | $805M |
| Northrop Grumman | 18 | $764M |

**Earlier Awards:**
- Rocket Lab: $515M for 18 Tranche 2 Transport Layer satellites (Jan 2024)
- York Space (now Firefly): Multiple Transport Layer awards
- Lockheed Martin, Northrop: Transport Layer Tranche 1 and 2 contracts

**Investment Significance:** SDA is deliberately distributing contracts across 4+ vendors per tranche, creating a competitive commercial supply chain for defense satellites. Rocket Lab's rise from launch provider to $1.3B+ satellite prime is a standout story.

## 3. Missile Warning & Tracking Programs

### Next-Gen OPIR (Lockheed Martin)

- **Mission:** Replace aging SBIRS constellation with more capable GEO missile warning satellites
- **Prime:** Lockheed Martin (bus: LM 2100) + Raytheon (sensor payload)
- **Status:** First GEO Block 0 satellite completed environmental testing Aug 2025; delivery to Space Force Sep 2025
- **Launch:** Slipped to no earlier than March 2026 (crowded manifest)
- **Program:** Two GEO satellites under contract (launches 2026, 2027); polar orbit variants also planned
- **Capability:** Detects dimmer, faster-burning advanced missile threats that legacy SBIRS cannot

### Resilient Missile Warning/Tracking

- Northrop Grumman won the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) development for the Missile Defense Agency (Sep 2024)
- SDA Tracking Layer provides complementary LEO-based tracking (see above)
- Integration of GEO (Next-Gen OPIR) + LEO (SDA Tracking) provides layered, resilient detection

## 4. Key Defense Primes -- Space Segments

### Lockheed Martin (LMT)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Space segment revenue (2023) | $12.6B |
| Space segment revenue (2024) | $12.5B (-1% YoY) |
| Total company revenue (2025) | $75.0B (+5.6% YoY) |
| Space operating margin (2024) | 9.8% (up from 9.2%) |

**Key Programs:** Next-Gen OPIR, GPS III/IIIF, Orion, SDA Tracking Layer, classified programs
**Outlook:** Space revenue dipped as legacy OPIR programs wound down; growth expected as Next-Gen OPIR, SDA Tranche 3, and Golden Dome ramp. Space Q1 2025 operating profit up 17% despite 2% revenue decline.

### Northrop Grumman (NOC)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Space Systems revenue (2024) | $11.7B |
| Space Systems revenue (2025 guidance) | ~$11.0B |
| Total company revenue (2024) | $41.0B (+4% YoY) |

**Key Programs:** SDA Transport/Tracking Layer, Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), James Webb support, Cygnus, in-orbit servicing, Golden Dome SBI prototype
**Headwinds:** $595M revenue decline from cancelled classified Space Force satellite program; lost Next-Gen Interceptor (NGI) to Lockheed
**Outlook:** Backlog remains strong; GPI and SDA contracts provide pipeline. In-space servicing/refueling tech is a differentiator.

### L3Harris (LHX)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Space & Airborne Systems revenue (2025) | $6.9B (+1% YoY) |
| Total company revenue (2025) | $21.9B (+3% YoY) |
| 2026 guidance | $23.0-23.5B (+6% midpoint) |

**Key Programs:** SDA Tracking Layer (Tranche 0 operational, T1/T2/T3 contracts), responsive space, HBTSS sensors, weather satellites
**Outlook:** Space flat in 2025 due to program timing; growth expected in 2026 as SDA production ramps. Reorganizing segments to better reflect space growth.

### RTX (RTX)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total revenue (2025) | $88.6B (+9.7% YoY) |
| NASA contract portfolio | $2.1B (2024) |

**Strategy Shift:** RTX is exiting satellite prime contracting to focus on components and subsystems (sensors, payloads, interceptors). Withdrew from SDA satellite contract after determining fixed-price terms were unprofitable. Supplies missile warning sensor payload for Next-Gen OPIR (Raytheon-built).
**Space Role:** Primarily a subsystem/payload supplier rather than space prime. Strong in missile defense interceptors (SM-3, GBI components), space sensors, and ground systems.

### Boeing (BA)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Defense, Space & Security revenue (2024) | $23.9B (-4% YoY) |
| BDS operating loss (2024) | -$5.4B |
| BDS revenue Q3 2025 | $6.9B (+25% YoY) |

**Challenges:** Starliner losses exceed $2B cumulative; exploring sale of space division programs. Fixed-price defense contracts continue generating losses.
**Space Programs:** SLS core stage, ISS operations, WGS satellites, Starliner (troubled), classified programs
**Outlook:** Potential exit from human spaceflight (Starliner sale). Revenue recovering in 2025 but profitability remains challenged. Not a growth story in space.

## 6. Golden Dome Missile Defense Program

### Overview
President Trump signed an executive order (Jan 27, 2025) directing construction of a comprehensive homeland missile defense system employing thousands of LEO satellites with sensors and interceptors, AI-enabled command and control.

### Budget
- **2025 Reconciliation:** $24.4B allocated (One Big Beautiful Bill Act)
- **FY2026 Defense Appropriations:** $13.4B for space and missile defense systems
- **Total near-term funding:** ~$38B committed

### Cost Estimates (Full System)
| Source | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| White House | $175B |
| Congressional Budget Office | $831B |
| American Enterprise Institute | $3.6T |

### Key Contractors
- **SpaceX:** Reportedly set to receive $2B contract for 600-satellite air moving target indicator constellation
- **Lockheed Martin:** SBI prototype, Next-Gen OPIR integration
- **Northrop Grumman:** SBI prototype
- **Anduril:** SBI prototype (non-traditional entrant)
- **True Anomaly:** SBI prototype (non-traditional entrant)
- **Procurement Vehicle:** SHIELD IDIQ -- 2,440 approved vendors out of 2,463 applicants

### Investment Implications
Golden Dome represents the largest single space defense procurement program in US history. Even if final architecture scales back from maximum estimates, the sensor/tracking satellite layer alone (SpaceX $2B contract) creates massive demand for launch, satellite buses, payloads, ground systems, and AI/ML software. Benefits SpaceX, Anduril, Palantir, and traditional primes. Risk: political/budget volatility given massive cost range.

## 9. Investment Themes & Risks

### Bull Case
1. **Structural budget growth:** USSF budget doubled in 5 years; Golden Dome adds step-function increase
2. **Bipartisan support:** Space defense has broad Congressional backing across party lines
3. **Proliferation imperative:** China/Russia threats driving shift from exquisite/few to proliferated/many satellites -- dramatically increases unit demand
4. **Commercial integration:** DoD increasingly buying commercial capabilities rather than building bespoke -- benefits commercial space companies
5. **Allied spending surge:** Japan, NATO, UK, Australia all increasing space defense budgets
6. **New entrants winning:** Anduril, True Anomaly, Rocket Lab, Slingshot proving non-traditional companies can win major defense space contracts

### Bear Case
1. **Golden Dome execution risk:** $175B-$3.6T cost range suggests undefined requirements; could be descoped or cancelled with administration change
2. **Fixed-price contract risk:** Boeing and RTX have taken billions in losses on fixed-price defense contracts; margin pressure is real
3. **Budget competition:** AUKUS submarines, Ukraine, and other priorities compete for defense dollars
4. **Classification opacity:** Much of the highest-value space defense work is classified, making revenue visibility poor
5. **Political risk:** Defense budgets subject to continuing resolutions, sequestration, and political cycles
6. **Technology risk:** Space-based interceptors are unproven at scale; sensor-to-shooter kill chains in space are extraordinarily complex

## 10. Summary

The US space defense sector is experiencing its most significant funding expansion since the Reagan-era SDI program. The confluence of Chinese counterspace threats, Golden Dome ambitions, and the proliferated architecture shift is creating a multi-decade investment cycle. Annual USSF spending is on track to exceed $40B by FY2026, with Golden Dome potentially adding hundreds of billions over the next decade.

The sector favors companies that can:
1. **Build satellites at volume and speed** (Rocket Lab, SpaceX, L3Harris)
2. **Deliver software-defined, AI-enabled capabilities** (Anduril, Palantir, Slingshot, True Anomaly)
3. **Provide the sensing and tracking backbone** (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris)
4. **Launch proliferated constellations rapidly** (SpaceX, Rocket Lab, ULA)

The biggest risk is political: Golden Dome's cost range spans 20x depending on the estimate, and administration changes could dramatically reshape priorities. The base SDA/PWSA program, however, has strong bipartisan support and represents a durable spending floor regardless of political shifts.
