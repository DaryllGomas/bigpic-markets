## Executive Summary

The space industry is entering a structural growth phase driven by three converging forces: **collapsing launch costs** (SpaceX's reusability revolution), **surging defense spending** (USSF budget doubled to ~$29B in 5 years, Golden Dome adding $38B+), and **commercial revenue inflection** (Starlink at $10B+ revenue, satellite services at $293B globally). The global space economy hit $613B in 2024 (+7.8% YoY) and is projected to reach $1T by 2032 and $1.8T by 2035.

**Core thesis:** We are in the early innings of a multi-decade space infrastructure buildout, analogous to the internet infrastructure boom of the late 1990s but with stronger government demand underpinning. The SpaceX IPO (mid-2026, ~$1.5T) will be the defining sector catalyst. Defense spending provides a durable floor. The best public investments combine proven revenue with exposure to structural growth tailwinds.

**Key risks:** SpaceX dominance limits competitive moats, space SPAC history shows most pre-revenue plays destroy capital (-65% avg from highs), Golden Dome cost estimates range 20x ($175B to $3.6T) suggesting undefined scope, and Chinese launch competition is accelerating.

## Key Sectors

### 1. Launch Services

**Dominated by SpaceX** with 167 Falcon 9 launches in 2025 (more than the rest of the world combined). Reusability has permanently lowered the cost floor -- booster refurbishment dropped from ~$13M to ~$1M. Starship targets sub-$100/kg, a 50x reduction from current Falcon 9 costs.

**Key players:**
- **SpaceX** (Private, IPO mid-2026): $1.5T target valuation, $15B+ revenue, 9.2M Starlink subscribers
- **Rocket Lab (RKLB)**: ~$44B market cap, 21 launches in 2025 (100% success), $1.1B backlog, Neutron in development
- **Blue Origin** (Private): New Glenn reached orbit Jan 2025, landed booster Nov 2025, 27 Kuiper launches contracted
- **Firefly (FLY)**: Small-cap, Alpha operational, Eclipse medium-lift in development
- **China**: 90 launches in 2025, multiple reusable rockets targeting 2026 first flights

**Thesis:** Launch is the enabling infrastructure layer. SpaceX has an insurmountable cost advantage. RKLB is the only pure-play public launch company with proven execution. The sector risk is commoditization and SpaceX dominance limiting competitors' margins.

### 2. Satellites & Infrastructure

**LEO broadband** is the fastest-growing segment. Starlink has 9M+ subscribers generating $10.4B revenue, growing 80%+ YoY. Amazon Kuiper launching consumer service in 2026 with $10B+ committed. Eutelsat ordered 340 new OneWeb satellites from Airbus (Jan 2026).

**Earth observation** is hitting an inflection point driven by defense demand. Planet Labs (PL) backlog surged 216% to $734.5M with major NATO military contracts. BlackSky (BKSY) has $322.7M backlog, 91% international.

**Key data points:**
- Goldman projects satellite market growing from ~$15B to $108B by 2035 (7x)
- EO small satellite market: $2.64B (2025) to $5.52B (2030), 15.9% CAGR
- NRO spending ~$400M/yr on commercial imagery

**Thesis:** Defense-driven EO demand is the most actionable investment theme. PL is the standout with backlog inflection and near-breakeven financials. The SpaceX IPO will reprice the entire satellite sector.

### 3. Defense & National Security Space

**The strongest structural tailwind.** USSF budget doubled from $15B to $29B in 5 years. FY2026 reaches $40B+ including Golden Dome reconciliation. SDA is deploying a proliferated LEO constellation (150+ satellites launching now, 254 in Tranche 2, 72+ in Tranche 3).

**Budget trajectory:**

| Fiscal Year | USSF Budget |
|-------------|-------------|
| FY2021 | $15.4B |
| FY2023 | $26.3B |
| FY2025 | $28.9B |
| FY2026 | $40.1B (with reconciliation) |

**Golden Dome** is the largest single space defense program in US history: $38B near-term funding committed, full system estimates range $175B-$3.6T. SpaceX reportedly receiving $2B for 600-satellite constellation.

**Defense prime space revenue:**
- Lockheed Martin (LMT): $12.5B space segment
- Northrop Grumman (NOC): $11.7B space systems
- L3Harris (LHX): $6.9B space & airborne
- Rocket Lab (RKLB): $1.3B+ SDA contracts (rising fast)

**Emerging defense space:** Anduril ($30.5B valuation, Golden Dome SBI), True Anomaly ($260M Series C, Jackal orbital defense), Slingshot Aerospace ($27M USSF AI training)

**Geopolitical drivers:** China PLA Aerospace Force, 73 launches in 2025, operational ASAT capabilities. Japan defense budget at $58B+ (record, +9.4% YoY). NATO Space Operations Centre operational. UK committed $6.2B to Skynet 6.

**Thesis:** Multi-decade defense cycle driven by China threat and proliferation shift. Bipartisan Congressional support. Benefits companies that can build satellites at volume (RKLB, LMT, LHX) and deliver AI-enabled capabilities (Anduril, PLTR). Golden Dome is high-risk/high-reward overlay.

### 4. Emerging Sectors

**Commercial space stations:** ISS retires end of 2030 (deorbit Jan 2031). Vast Haven-1 launches May 2026 (first commercial station). Axiom delayed to 2027 with financial strain. Starlab targeting 2028. Structural demand gap creates urgency.

**Lunar economy:** LUNR is the standout -- ~$275M FY2025 revenue, consensus $919M in 2026, two successful lunar landings, positive EBITDA expected 2026. Artemis II launches March 2026. Budget fights may accelerate commercial lunar architecture.

**In-space manufacturing:** Varda (private) completed 4 missions, targeting monthly cadence in 2026. Redwire (RDW) at $320-340M revenue. ZBLAN fiber scaling. Revenue inflection 2027-2028.

**Space tourism:** Pre-revenue for most. VG at $2.35 (-99% from ATH). Blue Origin paused 2 years. Avoid.

**Asteroid mining:** 2030s+ at best. AstroForge lost Odin spacecraft. Speculative.

| **BA** | Boeing (space) | $5.4B BDS operating loss, exploring space exits |

### Key Private Companies to Watch

| Company | Valuation | Event |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **SpaceX** | $800B -> $1.5T IPO | Mid-2026 IPO -- largest ever, defines sector |
| **Anduril** | $30.5B | Golden Dome, Arsenal-1 factory Jul 2026 |

## Investment Timing Framework

### Now (Q1 2026) -- Build Positions

- **PL**: Backlog inflection is real, defense tailwind accelerating, near breakeven
- **LUNR**: Revenue ramp to $919M in 2026, EBITDA positive, only public lunar play
- **UFO ETF**: Broad space sector exposure at reasonable cost
- **LMT/NOC**: Defense primes with strong space segments, Golden Dome beneficiaries

### Mid-2026 -- SpaceX IPO Decision Point

- Evaluate SpaceX IPO pricing vs. growth trajectory
- IPO will likely pull up all space valuations -- consider trimming positions that get overextended
- Watch for York Space Systems IPO as satellite manufacturing pure-play

### 2026-2027 -- Catalyst-Driven

- **RKLB**: Neutron first flight is make-or-break for the bull case at current valuation
- **BKSY**: International contract pipeline converting to revenue
- **Haven-1 launch** (Vast): Validates commercial stations
- **Artemis II** (March 2026): Renewed lunar enthusiasm

### 2028-2030 -- Structural Themes

- Commercial station transition as ISS retires
- In-space manufacturing revenue inflection (Varda, Redwire)
- Defense constellation buildout (SDA Tranche 2-3 operational)
- Potential Varda/Vast IPOs

### 2030+ -- Long-Duration Themes

- Lunar infrastructure and ISRU
- Full commercial station ecosystem
- Space manufacturing at scale
- Asteroid mining (speculative)

---

## Risk Factors

### Macro Risks
1. **SpaceX concentration**: One company dominates launch, LEO broadband, and defense -- sector-wide key-person/company risk
2. **Valuation stretch**: RKLB trades at extreme P/S ratios; SpaceX IPO pricing in decades of growth
3. **Political/budget volatility**: Golden Dome cost range spans 20x; administration change could reshape priorities
4. **Chinese competition**: 90 launches in 2025, multiple reusable rockets in 2026, could undercut pricing for non-ITAR payloads

### Sector-Specific Risks
5. **SPAC history**: Average space SPAC lost -65% from highs; pre-revenue companies consistently destroy value
6. **Technical risk**: Starship still in development (5 of 11 launches failed in 2025), Neutron had tank rupture, new vehicles frequently fail
7. **Demand concentration**: Mega-constellation deployment drives bulk of launch demand; if buildout plateaus, demand drops
8. **Fixed-price contract losses**: Boeing and RTX lost billions on fixed-price defense contracts; margin risk is real

### Mitigants
- Defense spending has bipartisan support and structural China threat driver
- Commercial revenue (Starlink $10B+) provides non-government demand floor
- Multiple catalysts in 2026 (SpaceX IPO, Artemis II, Haven-1, Kuiper consumer launch)
- Space ETFs (UFO) provide diversified exposure to reduce single-stock risk
