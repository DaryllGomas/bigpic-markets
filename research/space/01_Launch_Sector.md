## Market Overview

The global space launch services market is estimated at $21-27B in 2025, growing to $24-32B in 2026 (varies by research firm methodology). Projected CAGR of 12-17% through 2032-2035, with estimates ranging from $41B (Grand View Research, 2030) to $82B (Research & Markets, 2032).

The market is dominated by two dynamics:
1. SpaceX's reusability-driven cost destruction, which has permanently lowered the price floor
2. Surging demand from satellite mega-constellations (Starlink, Kuiper, OneWeb, Telesat)

North America leads with ~61% of global launches in 2025.

- **List price:** $67M per launch ($62M advertised for standard missions)
- **Internal Starlink cost:** Estimated $28M per launch
- **Cost per kg to LEO:** ~$2,700/kg (Falcon 9), ~$1,500/kg (Falcon Heavy)
- **Turnaround time:** As fast as 13 days between flights
- **Refurbishment cost:** Dropped from ~$13M to ~$1M per booster over five years (ARK estimate)

### Starlink (Revenue Engine)

- **Subscribers:** 9.2M+ as of end-2025 (doubled from 4.6M at end-2024)
- **2026 projection:** Could reach 18.4M subscribers
- **Revenue share:** Starlink expected to be ~79% of total SpaceX revenue in 2026
- **Satellites deployed in 2025:** 3,000+ across 123 dedicated Starlink Falcon 9 missions

### Starship Development

- **2025 performance:** 11 launches (6 successes, 5 failures); first four Block 2 upper stages failed
- **Block 3:** Expected to bring significant improvements for 2026 launch cadence ramp
- **Infrastructure:** Building toward 5 total launch pads (2 at Starbase TX, 1+ at LC-39A FL)
- **East Coast debut:** LC-39A Starship pad targeting second half of 2026
- **Cost targets:** $78-94/kg with partial reusability (6 flights); $13-32/kg with high reusability (20-70 flights); long-term goal of $10-20/kg
- **Schedule risk:** Program has repeatedly missed optimistic timelines

### IPO

- Confirmed by Musk in Dec 2025; targeting mid-June 2026
- Four banks selected to lead; could be the largest IPO ever
- Valuation discussions center around $1.5T, seeking to raise up to $50B
- IPO is primarily a Starlink valuation event

### Investment Thesis (SpaceX)

**Bull case:** Starlink subscriber growth trajectory, Starship cost disruption, monopoly-like launch market position, government/defense contracts
**Bear case:** Starship development delays, $1.5T valuation pricing in decades of growth, Musk key-person risk, regulatory risk, competition from Chinese launchers

## Rocket Lab (RKLB)

**Ticker:** NASDAQ: RKLB
**Market Cap:** ~$44B (late 2025; fluctuating)
**Stock Performance:** +188% in 2025, +1,775% over 3 years
**Analyst Consensus:** Moderate Buy, price target $61.25

### Electron (Small Launch)

- **2025 launches:** 21 missions, 100% success rate (record year)
- **Total launches:** 79 missions since 2017 debut
- **Overall success rate:** ~95% (75/79 successes)
- **Position:** Second-most active launch provider globally, most active small-launch provider
- **Market:** Dedicated small satellite launches (300 kg to LEO)

### Neutron (Medium Launch - In Development)

- **Target:** Medium-lift partially reusable rocket (13,000 kg to LEO)
- **Status:** January 2026 Stage 1 tank rupture during testing introduces schedule risk
- **Timeline:** Vehicle arriving at Launch Complex 3 in Q1 2026, first launch thereafter (pending qualification)
- **Significance:** Positions RKLB to compete for larger payloads and constellation deployment

### Space Systems (Non-Launch Revenue)

- **Q3 2025 revenue:** $155M (record), 48% YoY growth, 37% GAAP gross margin
- **Q4 2025 guidance:** $170-180M revenue
- **2026 revenue forecast:** ~$900M as defense and space systems backlog converts
- **Backlog:** $1.1B
- **Major contract:** $816M U.S. Space Development Agency deal (largest ever)

### Investment Thesis (RKLB)

**Bull case:** Proven small-launch execution, diversified Space Systems revenue, Neutron opens medium-launch TAM, strong defense backlog, only pure-play publicly traded launch company
**Bear case:** Extremely high valuation (P/S ratio very elevated), Neutron delays/failures could destroy sentiment, still unprofitable, SpaceX rideshare competition for small sats

## ULA / Vulcan Centaur

**Ownership:** Joint venture of Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) - not directly investable as standalone
**Vehicle:** Vulcan Centaur (replacing Atlas V and Delta IV)

### Status

- **First launch:** January 8, 2024 (Peregrine lunar lander)
- **NSSL certification:** March 2025 (after two certification flights)
- **2025 launches:** Forecast 9 launches; actual performance fell short
- **2026 forecast:** 20-25 launches planned ("pretty crowded" manifest)
- **Performance criticism:** Space Force called 2025 performance "unsatisfactory" due to slow Atlas/Delta transition

### Key Details

- **Engines:** Blue Origin BE-4 (first stage), Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10 (Centaur upper stage)
- **Upgrade:** RL10E engine coming late 2025+ for improved thrust and specific impulse
- **Market:** Primarily U.S. national security space launches (NSSL Phase 2 contract)
- **Not reusable:** Expendable vehicle; competes on reliability and mission assurance, not cost

### Investment Angle

Not directly investable. Indirect exposure via LMT or BA, but ULA is a small fraction of either company's revenue. ULA's long-term competitive position is challenging given SpaceX's cost advantage.

## Blue Origin

**Status:** Private (Jeff Bezos-funded)
**Not publicly traded**

### New Glenn

- **First launch:** January 16, 2025 - reached orbit successfully, but first stage lost on descent
- **Second launch:** November 13, 2025 - orbit achieved AND first-stage landing on drone ship (second company ever to do so)
- **Payload capacity:** 45,000 kg to LEO (standard); 70,000+ kg (announced 9x4 variant)
- **NG-3:** Scheduled early 2026 (Blue Moon Mark 1 uncrewed lunar lander)

### Project Kuiper (Amazon Constellation)

- **Contract:** 12 launches confirmed, options for up to 15 additional (up to 27 total)
- **Capacity:** 61 satellites per New Glenn launch
- **Timeline:** Mid-2026 target for Kuiper constellation deployment launches

### Future Development

- **New Glenn 9x4:** Announced November 2025; super heavy-lift variant with 9 BE-4 engines (first stage) and 4 BE-3U engines (second stage); 70,000+ kg to LEO
- **Blue Moon:** Lunar lander for NASA Artemis program (competing with SpaceX HLS)

### Investment Angle

Not investable directly. Amazon (AMZN) provides indirect exposure via Project Kuiper, which is a $10B+ capital commitment.

2. **Marginal cost declining** - Booster refurbishment costs dropped from ~$13M to ~$1M over 5 years
3. **Starship disruption potential** - If Starship achieves even partial reuse targets ($78-94/kg), it will be 20-30x cheaper than current Falcon 9
4. **Industry-wide reusability race** - Blue Origin (New Glenn), Rocket Lab (Neutron), Relativity (Terran R), Stoke (Nova), and multiple Chinese firms all pursuing reusable designs
5. **Projected milestone:** Reusable vehicles could reduce costs below $500/kg by 2028

## Key Risks & Considerations

### Sector-Wide Risks

1. **SpaceX dominance** - One company controls >50% of global launches; competitors struggle to match cost structure
2. **Valuation disconnect** - RKLB trades at extreme revenue multiples; SpaceX IPO pricing in decades of growth
3. **Technical risk** - Starship still in development; Neutron had tank rupture; new vehicles frequently fail
4. **Regulatory/political** - Launch licensing, ITAR restrictions, geopolitical tensions with China
5. **Demand concentration** - Mega-constellation deployment (Starlink, Kuiper) drives bulk of demand; if buildout slows, launch demand drops

### Bull Thesis for the Sector

- Space economy projected to reach $1.8T by 2035 (Morgan Stanley) - launch is the enabling infrastructure
- Reusability is permanently lowering the cost floor, expanding the addressable market
- Defense spending on space is accelerating (SDA, Space Force, allied nations)
- New applications (space manufacturing, tourism, lunar economy) emerging
- Starship-class vehicles could enable entirely new categories of space activity

### Bear Thesis for the Sector

- SpaceX's cost advantage may be insurmountable for competitors
- Launch is becoming commoditized; margins may compress
- Many "emerging" launchers have failed (ABL, Virgin Orbit, Astra) - high mortality rate
- Satellite demand could plateau after initial constellation buildouts
- Chinese competition could undercut Western pricing for non-ITAR payloads
