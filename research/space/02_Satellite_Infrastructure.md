## 1. LEO Broadband Constellations

### Starlink (SpaceX) -- Market Dominant

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active Subscribers | **9M+** (Dec 2025), up from 8M in Nov 2025 |
| Countries Served | 155 |
| Growth Rate | ~20,000 new users/day |
| 2025 Revenue | **$10.4B** (69% of SpaceX's $15B total) |
| 2024 Revenue | $7.7B (+83% YoY) |
| 2026 Revenue Forecast | **$18.7B** (Payload estimate, +80% YoY) |
| 2026 Subscriber Forecast | ~18.4M (doubling again) |

**SpaceX IPO (2026):** Musk confirmed a 2026 IPO with valuation target above **$1 trillion**. Private market valuations already at ~$800B. Revenue could reach $24B total in 2026. The IPO is fundamentally a Starlink/ISP play -- satellite internet is 70%+ of revenue.

**Investment Angle:** No direct public stock access until IPO. SpaceX/Starlink is the 800-lb gorilla that defines the entire LEO broadband category. Pre-IPO shares trade on secondary markets at nosebleed valuations.

### Amazon Kuiper (Project Kuiper / "Amazon Leo")

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Investment | **$10B+** committed |
| FCC Mandate | 50% of constellation by July 2026, 100% by July 2029 |
| Satellites Launched (2025) | ~75 operational (27 initial + 3 batches of ~24) |
| Next Launch | Feb 12, 2026 (Arianespace, 32 satellites) |
| Planned Constellation | 3,236 LEO satellites + 300+ ground stations |
| Consumer Availability | Starting 2026 |

Amazon unveiled the **Leo Ultra** enterprise terminal (phased-array, up to 1 Gbps down / 400 Mbps up). Consumer service expected to begin in 2026. Amazon has the balance sheet to compete with Starlink but is 3+ years behind on deployment.

**Investment Angle:** Embedded in Amazon (AMZN). Kuiper is a rounding error on Amazon's financials today but could become material. No pure-play exposure.

### Eutelsat OneWeb

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Constellation | 600+ satellites at 1,200 km altitude |
| New Satellite Order | **340 from Airbus** (Jan 2026), total 440 on order |
| First Deliveries | Late 2026 (5G-integrated upgrades) |
| Target Constellation | 1,040 satellites total |
| Stock | Eutelsat (ETL.PA, Paris) |

Eutelsat completed its merger with OneWeb in Sep 2023 ($6.4B combined entity). Unified branding in Sep 2025. Ordered 100 replacement satellites from Airbus in Dec 2024, then 340 more in Jan 2026 to expand to 1,040 total. Focused on enterprise, maritime, aviation, and government connectivity.

### Telesat Lightspeed

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Constellation Size | 156 satellites planned |
| Funding | **$2.54B** secured (government-backed) |
| Manufacturer | MDA Space (new Quebec factory opening early 2026) |
| Pathfinder Launch | Late 2026 (2 test satellites) |
| Full Deployment | Late 2027 |
| Commercial Service | After 96 of 156 satellites operational |
| Backlog | CAD $1.1B |
| Stock | TSAT (NASDAQ) |

Telesat is the smallest of the major LEO broadband players. Government backing (Canadian) is a differentiator. MDA Space is building a dedicated high-volume factory. Service targeting enterprise and government, not consumer.

## 4. Ground Systems & Terminals

### Market Size
- **2024:** $6.9B (ground station equipment)
- **2033E:** $13.2B (CAGR 8.2%)
- **Phased Array Antenna market:** $3.3B (2025), growing rapidly

### Key Developments

**Phased Array Terminals:**
- Critical enabling technology for LEO constellations (electronically steerable, no moving parts)
- Starlink's user terminal cost has dropped dramatically (from ~$3,000 to manufacture to ~$599 retail for standard dish)
- Amazon Leo Ultra: Enterprise-grade phased array, up to 1 Gbps, targeting enterprise/government
- Cost reduction in flat-panel antennas is the key driver of LEO broadband adoption

**AWS Ground Station:**
- Ground-station-as-a-service model: eliminates need to build/operate own ground infrastructure
- Global network near AWS regions
- Enables satellite operators to downlink data directly to cloud compute
- Competes with KSAT, SSC, Atlas Space Operations

**Other Ground Network Operators:**
- **KSAT** (Kongsberg Satellite Services) -- largest commercial ground station network
- **SSC** (Swedish Space Corporation) -- global ground station network
- **Atlas Space Operations** -- cloud-based ground segment

**Investment Angle:** Ground systems are largely embedded in larger companies (Amazon/AWS, Kongsberg, SSC). No major pure-play public companies. The real investment thesis is that ground infrastructure scales linearly with constellation size -- every new LEO satellite needs ground segment support.

## 5. Space Situational Awareness (SSA) / Space Domain Awareness (SDA)

### Market Context
- 40,000+ tracked objects in orbit, growing rapidly with mega-constellations
- US government transitioning from DoD-only tracking (space-track.org) to civilian-led system
- **TraCSS** (Traffic Coordination System for Space) launching via NOAA, expected online by late 2025

### Key Companies

| Company | Focus | Key Contracts |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| **LeoLabs** | Radar tracking (LEO) | **$60M STRATFI** radar contract for Indo-Pacific coverage |
| **ExoAnalytic Solutions** | Optical tracking (GEO) | NOAA TraCSS pilot (GEO data provider) |
| **Slingshot Aerospace** | Software/analytics | $5.3-13.3M persistent monitoring contracts, Sovereign Space Object Tracking product (Apr 2025) |
| **COMSPOC** | Catalog maintenance | Office of Space Commerce pathfinder |

All four companies participate in the "Space Situational Awareness Coalition" working with the Office of Space Commerce.

**Space Force Integration:** The Joint Commercial Operations model uses short-duration (4-6 week) competitive contracts with LeoLabs, ExoAnalytic, Slingshot, and COMSPOC.

**Investment Angle:** All private companies currently. LeoLabs is furthest along with $60M+ contracts. Slingshot launched a commercial product for sovereign nations. This is a growing market driven by orbital congestion, but no public pure-plays exist yet. Watch for potential IPOs as the market matures.
