# Quantum Networking & Communications

## Executive Summary

Quantum networking and communications represents one of the most commercially actionable segments of the broader quantum technology stack. Unlike quantum computing, which remains years from broad enterprise utility, quantum-safe security is an urgent, present-day requirement driven by regulatory mandates (CNSA 2.0, OMB M-23-02), the "harvest now, decrypt later" threat, and NIST's finalization of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards in August 2024. The sector spans three distinct but interconnected markets: quantum key distribution (QKD), post-quantum cryptography (PQC), and the longer-term quantum internet/networking infrastructure. Combined TAM estimates range from $10.5B to $15B by 2035 (McKinsey), with PQC alone projected to reach $2.8B by 2030 at a 46% CAGR. The investment landscape favors PQC software plays in the near term (2025-2028) and integrated quantum networking platforms in the medium term (2028-2035), while pure-play QKD hardware faces distance limitations and competition from software-only PQC approaches.

## 1. Quantum Internet: Vision and Architecture

### The Long-Term Vision

The quantum internet aims to connect quantum processors, sensors, and communication nodes via entanglement distribution, enabling capabilities impossible with classical networks: unconditionally secure communication, distributed quantum computing, and precision sensor networks. Unlike the classical internet, the quantum internet transmits quantum states (qubits) rather than classical bits, leveraging entanglement and superposition as fundamental network primitives.

### DOE Quantum Internet Blueprint

The U.S. Department of Energy published its quantum internet blueprint in 2020, establishing four developmental milestones:

1. **Verify** secure quantum protocols over existing fiber optic networks
2. **Send** entangled information across campuses or cities (metropolitan scale)
3. **Expand** networks between cities (intercity scale)
4. **Scale** between states using quantum repeaters (continental scale)

The blueprint requires coordination across DOE, NSF, DoD, NIST, NSA, and NASA, along with national laboratories and industry. As of early 2026, the field is transitioning from milestone 1 to milestone 2, with several metropolitan-scale quantum networks operational.

### Key Infrastructure: Quantum Repeaters

Quantum repeaters are the critical enabling technology for long-distance quantum networks. Unlike classical repeaters that amplify signals, quantum repeaters must perform entanglement swapping and purification without measuring (and thereby destroying) the quantum states they handle.

**Prototype Status (2025-2026):**

- **USTC (China), February 2026:** Demonstrated the world's first scalable quantum repeater building block, achieving memory-memory entanglement between two nodes connected by 10 km of spooled fiber that survives beyond the average entanglement establishment time. The team developed a long-lived trapped-ion quantum memory, a highly efficient ion-photon interface, and a high-fidelity experimental protocol. They transmitted secure keys over 11 km of optical fiber (3,000x farther than previous demonstrations) and verified that secure keys could in principle be generated over 100 km of fiber.

- **University of Stuttgart, November 2025:** Achieved quantum teleportation between photons generated by different quantum dots, a prerequisite for heterogeneous quantum network nodes. By creating nearly identical semiconductor-based photon sources and using frequency converters, researchers transferred quantum states across a fiber link.

- **Fermilab/Caltech, September 2025:** Demonstrated squeezed light techniques that dramatically increase the rate at which quantum networks generate entangled particle pairs over long distances, addressing a critical throughput bottleneck.

### Timeline Estimates

Practical quantum repeaters enabling continental-scale networks remain 8-15 years away. Metropolitan-scale networks (under 100 km) are functional today. Intercity networks (100-500 km) using trusted relay nodes are operational in China and under deployment in Europe. True end-to-end quantum-secured continental networks without trusted relay nodes require mature quantum repeaters, realistically placing them in the 2035-2040 timeframe.

### Investment: New York Quantum Testbed

In September 2025, New York state and university leaders announced a $300 million investment to convert Long Island's existing telecom fiber into a quantum testbed, centered on SUNY Stony Brook's Quantum Research and Innovation Hub -- a 14,000 m2 facility designed to host the first data center built to manage entangled photons. The project supports a decade-long plan to refine quantum repeaters, connect atomic clocks and sensors, and eventually link quantum computers.

## 2. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

### The BB84 Protocol

BB84, developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984, remains the foundational QKD protocol. It works by transmitting single photons encoded in randomly chosen quantum states using one of two complementary bases. The security guarantee derives from quantum mechanics: the no-cloning theorem ensures that any eavesdropper intercepting and measuring photons will introduce detectable errors, alerting legitimate users.

**Practical Limitations:**
- Distance constrained to 100-150 km over fiber without repeaters (photon loss)
- Requires dedicated fiber or free-space optical links (cannot run over existing internet infrastructure)
- Low key generation rates compared to classical key exchange
- Vulnerable to implementation side-channel attacks (detector blinding, Trojan horse)
- Requires specialized and expensive single-photon detectors

### Commercial QKD Systems

**ID Quantique (now IonQ subsidiary):** Swiss pioneer in QKD, acquired by IonQ in February 2025 for $250 million. Products include the Cerberis XGR QKD platform, quantum random number generators (QRNGs), and single-photon detectors. IDQ has deployed systems in over 60 countries and holds a leading patent portfolio in quantum-safe networking. The acquisition brought nearly 300 granted and pending patents to IonQ, pushing its total above 900.

**Toshiba QKD:** In March 2025, Toshiba Europe launched a commercial QKD system integrating PQC (NIST's ML-KEM standard), offering hybrid quantum-classical security as a software upgrade for existing deployments. In June 2025, Toshiba signed a commercial agreement with Orange Business to launch France's first commercial quantum-safe network service. Toshiba holds the distance record for fiber-based QKD at over 600 km using twin-field QKD.

**QuantumCTek (China):** Supplied equipment for China's Beijing-Shanghai quantum backbone and Micius satellite network. Dominant position in the Chinese government/military QKD market.

### China's Quantum Communication Network

China has built the world's most extensive quantum communication infrastructure:

- **Beijing-Shanghai Trunk Line:** A 2,000 km terrestrial fiber-based quantum network connecting 32 trusted relay nodes across major cities. Integrated with Micius via ground stations to form the first space-to-ground quantum communications network.

- **Jinan-1 Microsatellite:** Launched as the first of a planned QKD constellation, orbiting at ~500 km with key generation rates 100-1,000x faster than Micius and significantly cheaper ground terminals.

- **12,900 km Record (March 2025):** Using Micius as a trusted relay, China demonstrated secure key sharing and encrypted communication between Beijing and Stellenbosch, South Africa -- the longest-distance quantum-secured communication link achieved.

- **Global Ambitions:** China aims to launch a global quantum communication service by 2027, leveraging quantum satellites to secure transmissions among BRICS nations.

### European EuroQCI Initiative

The European Quantum Communication Infrastructure (EuroQCI) is a pan-EU initiative to deploy a quantum-safe communication network across all 27 member states by 2030:

- **Current Status:** 26 member states are deploying national terrestrial quantum communication networks for testing QKD systems in real-world environments.

- **Eagle-1 Satellite:** Developed by ESA and an industrial consortium, scheduled for launch in late 2025 or early 2026. Will serve as the QKD test satellite for the space segment of EuroQCI.

- **2026 Milestones:** Operational activities begin from 2026, with a pilot facility for the European Quantum Internet supporting testing of quantum-safe components, secure quantum-cloud services, and distributed computing validation.

- **2030 Target:** Fully operational quantum-safe communication network with cross-border terrestrial quantum links connecting member states, as a first step toward a federated Quantum Internet.

- **Budget:** The European Commission allocated over EUR 1 billion to quantum technologies under the Quantum Europe Strategy (July 2025), covering EuroQCI infrastructure, research, and industrial development.

### SK Telecom / Samsung QKD Networks

SK Telecom has been a pioneer in commercial quantum security in Asia:

- Built a pilot QKD infrastructure in South Korea serving 17 institutions across public, medical, and industrial sectors.

- Developed the world's first hybrid QKD-PQC device combining quantum key distribution with NIST-standard PQC algorithms, providing defense-in-depth.

- In 2020, SK Telecom, ID Quantique, and Samsung launched the first 5G smartphone with a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) chipset.

- In 2025, SK Telecom agreed to exchange its IDQ shares for a stake in IonQ, tying the companies together. SKT will combine IonQ's trapped-ion quantum computing with its own AI platforms and telecom infrastructure, integrating quantum cryptography into AI data centers.

### QKD Market Sizing

## 3. Entanglement Distribution Infrastructure

### Quantum Memory

Quantum memory -- the ability to store quantum states for later retrieval -- is essential for quantum repeaters and synchronization across network nodes. Leading approaches include:

- **Trapped ions:** Longest coherence times (minutes to hours), demonstrated in the February 2026 USTC repeater milestone. Most promising for near-term quantum repeater nodes.
- **Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond:** Room-temperature operation possible, but shorter coherence times. Basis of several European quantum network testbeds.
- **Atomic ensembles:** High bandwidth potential but challenging to integrate with fiber networks.
- **Rare-earth-doped crystals:** Emerging platform with promising multiplexing capabilities.

### Satellite-Based Entanglement

China's Micius satellite demonstrated satellite-based entanglement distribution over 1,200 km in 2017, proving the feasibility of space-based quantum links. Key advantages of satellite-based approaches include overcoming fiber photon loss limitations (atmospheric loss is lower than fiber loss for distances above ~100 km) and enabling global-scale quantum networks without repeaters by using satellites as trusted nodes.

The Jinan-1 microsatellite (launched 2024-2025) represents the next generation: smaller, cheaper, and faster key generation. China plans additional launches through 2025-2027 to build a QKD constellation.

In Europe, ESA's Eagle-1 satellite (2025-2026 launch) will test QKD from low Earth orbit, providing data for the EuroQCI space segment. Multiple European startups and national programs are developing competing satellite QKD platforms.

### Fiber-Based Quantum Networks

Operational fiber-based quantum networks as of early 2026:

- **China:** Beijing-Shanghai backbone (2,000 km, 32 nodes), plus regional networks in Jinan, Hefei, and Wuhan.
- **United States:** EPB Quantum Network in Chattanooga, TN (first commercially available quantum network, launched 2022, expanded via IonQ's $22M deal). New York Long Island testbed ($300M, announced September 2025).
- **Europe:** Multiple national testbeds under EuroQCI, including the Madrid Quantum Network, UK Quantum Network, and Dutch QuTech-based networks.
- **South Korea:** SK Telecom pilot infrastructure serving 17 institutions.
- **Japan:** Toshiba-led quantum networks in Tokyo metropolitan area.

## 4. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

### NIST PQC Standards (Finalized August 2024)

NIST released three Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for post-quantum cryptography:

| Standard | Algorithm | Type | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| **FIPS 203 (ML-KEM)** | CRYSTALS-Kyber | Key Encapsulation | Encrypting data in transit, key exchange |
| **FIPS 204 (ML-DSA)** | CRYSTALS-Dilithium | Digital Signature | Code signing, authentication, certificates |
| **FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA)** | SPHINCS+ | Digital Signature | Backup/conservative signature scheme |

All three standards are based on mathematical problems believed to be resistant to both classical and quantum attacks. ML-KEM and ML-DSA use lattice-based cryptography (Module Learning with Errors), while SLH-DSA uses hash-based cryptography.

**Additional Standards in Pipeline:**
- **FN-DSA (Falcon):** A lattice-based signature scheme offering smaller signatures than ML-DSA, currently undergoing standardization.
- **HQC:** Selected in March 2025 as a backup key encapsulation mechanism (code-based cryptography, providing algorithmic diversity). Draft standard expected in 2026.

### The "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" Threat

The most urgent driver for PQC adoption is the HNDL threat: adversaries (primarily nation-states) are collecting and storing encrypted data today with the expectation of decrypting it once cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) become available. This threat is already active -- major cybersecurity agencies including DHS, NCSC (UK), ENISA (EU), and ACSC (Australia) assess that state-level adversaries are currently exfiltrating sensitive, long-lived data.

**CRQC Timeline Estimates:**
- Early 2025 research showed RSA-2048 breaking could require under one million physical qubits with runtimes of hours to days, a significant reduction from earlier estimates of billions of qubits
- Consensus estimates: 2030 +/- 3 years for initial CRQC capability against RSA-2048
- Data with a secrecy shelf life exceeding 5-10 years is already at risk, making PQC migration urgent today

### NSA CNSA 2.0 Requirements

The NSA's Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 establishes mandatory quantum-resistant cryptography timelines for National Security Systems (NSS):

| Deadline | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **January 1, 2027** | All new NSS acquisitions must be CNSA 2.0 compliant |
| **2027** | Operating systems must support and prefer CNSA 2.0 |
| **2030** | All deployed software/firmware using CNSA 2.0 signatures; non-compliant equipment phased out |
| **2031** | Full enforcement of CNSA 2.0 across all NSS cryptographic implementations |
| **2033** | Operating systems, niche equipment, custom apps, and legacy systems use CNSA 2.0 exclusively |
| **2035** | All U.S. national security systems fully quantum-resistant (aligned with NSM-10) |

### OMB Memo M-23-02 and Federal Migration

OMB Memorandum 23-02 (November 2022) directs all federal agencies to:

1. Designate a cryptographic inventory and migration lead
2. Conduct comprehensive, ongoing cryptographic inventory of all systems
3. Prioritize critical and sensitive systems for PQC migration
4. Report quantum-vulnerable cryptographic systems to the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) and CISA

**The preliminary government-wide cost estimate for PQC migration from 2025 to 2035 is approximately $7.1 billion** (in 2024 dollars), representing a massive addressable market for PQC vendors serving the federal sector alone.

Additional federal mandates include TLS 1.3 (or successor) adoption required by January 2, 2030, and CISA/NSA publication of quantum-safe product categories by December 1, 2025.

## 5. Quantum-Safe Migration

### Enterprise Migration Roadmap

The typical enterprise PQC migration follows four phases:

1. **Discovery (Now):** Inventory all cryptographic assets, protocols, libraries, and certificates across the organization. Identify quantum-vulnerable algorithms (RSA, ECC, DH, DSA).
2. **Risk Assessment (2025-2026):** Prioritize systems by data sensitivity and secrecy shelf life. Highest priority: long-lived secrets (national security, healthcare, financial, IP).
3. **Hybrid Deployment (2026-2028):** Deploy hybrid classical-PQC approaches where both classical and post-quantum algorithms protect data simultaneously. This provides defense-in-depth during the transition.
4. **Full Migration (2028-2033):** Transition to PQC-only cryptography as standards mature, implementations are battle-tested, and interoperability is confirmed.

### Hybrid Classical-PQC Approaches

Hybrid approaches combine traditional algorithms (RSA/ECC) with PQC algorithms in a single cryptographic operation, ensuring security even if one algorithm is broken. This strategy is endorsed by NIST, NSA, and major browser vendors. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari have already begun deploying hybrid key exchange (ML-KEM + X25519) in TLS connections.

### PQC-as-a-Service Providers

**Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) + IBM ($IBM):** In January 2026, announced a joint Quantum-Safe Readiness solution combining Palo Alto's network cryptographic visibility and automated cryptographic asset inventory with IBM Consulting's quantum-safe transformation services.

| ID Quantique | February/May 2025 | $250M | QKD systems, QRNGs, detectors, ~300 patents |
| SK Telecom partnership | 2025 | Equity exchange | Asian telecom channel, AI data center integration |

Post-acquisitions, IonQ controls 900+ patents and offers end-to-end quantum solutions spanning computing, networking, and security. The $22M EPB deal in Chattanooga represents the first U.S. quantum computing and networking hub. IonQ raised $360M through an ATM equity offering in March 2025, bringing cash reserves above $700M.

**Risk factors:** Elevated valuation relative to revenue (~170x trailing); acquisition integration risk across three major deals; quantum computing revenue still pre-scale; competition from pure-play PQC software companies in the near-term security market.

### Arqit Quantum ($ARQQ) -- Quantum Encryption Platform

**Market Cap:** ~$300-420M (January-February 2026)
**Revenue:** FY2025 (ended September 30, 2025): $530K from seven contracts
**FY2026 Guidance:** $1.2M in booked contracts as of September 30, 2025

Arqit's Quantum Cloud platform generates symmetric encryption keys using a software-based approach that does not require QKD hardware, differentiating it from hardware-dependent competitors. Revenue is extremely early-stage, with two telecom operator contracts and five government/defense/enterprise contracts.

**Risk factors:** Minimal revenue relative to market cap (~600-800x trailing); technology claims have faced skepticism from cryptography experts; competitive vulnerability to NIST-standard PQC solutions that are free and open-source; cash runway concerns.

### SandboxAQ (Private) -- AI-Quantum Security

**Valuation:** $5.75B (April 2025 Series E)
**Total Funding:** $950M+
**Key Investors:** Google/Alphabet, Eric Schmidt, Nvidia, Ray Dalio, BNP Paribas

The highest-valued pure-play in quantum-safe security. SandboxAQ's AQtive Guard platform provides enterprise cryptographic discovery, risk assessment, and migration management. The company's dual AI-quantum focus gives it a broader revenue base than PQC-only competitors. Clients include major telecoms (Vodafone, SoftBank), healthcare (Mount Sinai), and U.S. government agencies.

**Risk factors:** High valuation for a pre-IPO company; revenue figures not publicly disclosed; competition from established cybersecurity vendors (Palo Alto, IBM) entering the PQC space.

### PQShield (Private) -- PQC Hardware/Software IP

**Total Funding:** $65.1M
**Key Investors:** Addition (lead), Accenture Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures, AWS Startups

PQShield occupies a unique niche: providing PQC intellectual property that semiconductor companies embed into chips. This positions PQShield to capture value at the hardware layer as IoT, automotive, and mobile devices transition to PQC. The company's 100+ research papers and deep involvement in NIST standardization give it credibility in an industry where cryptographic rigor matters.

**Risk factors:** Revenue not disclosed; long sales cycles for semiconductor IP; competition from in-house PQC development at large chipmakers (ARM, Qualcomm, Intel).

### QuSecure (Private) -- PQC-as-a-Service

**Total Funding:** $33M (Series A)
**Key Investors:** Two Bear Capital (lead), Accenture Ventures

QuSecure's QuProtect platform targets enterprise and government customers needing turnkey PQC migration. The crypto-agility approach -- supporting multiple algorithms and enabling rapid swaps -- addresses the risk that any single PQC algorithm might be compromised. Early mover in the PQC-as-a-service model.

**Risk factors:** Modest funding relative to SandboxAQ; competitive pressure from larger cybersecurity vendors; federal contract cycles can be slow.

### Aliro Quantum (Private) -- Quantum Network Management

**Total Funding:** $2.7M
**Key Investors:** Accenture Ventures, Cisco Investments, Flybridge Leaders Fund

Harvard spin-off building the software layer for quantum networks (analogous to network management software for classical networks). Platform now supports 50+ quantum network devices. Positioned to become the orchestration layer as quantum networks scale, but extremely early-stage with minimal funding.

**Risk factors:** Very small funding base; quantum network deployments are still limited; long timeline to significant revenue.

### Toshiba (TYO: 6502) -- QKD Hardware Leader

**Context:** Toshiba's Quantum Technology division is a leader in QKD hardware but is a small part of the $25B+ Toshiba conglomerate. The March 2025 launch of a hybrid QKD+PQC system and the June 2025 commercial deal with Orange Business in France signal commercial traction. Toshiba holds distance records for fiber-based QKD (600+ km using twin-field QKD) and has the engineering depth to scale production.

### QuantumCTek (SHA: 688027) -- Chinese QKD Leader

China's dominant QKD equipment provider, supplying the Beijing-Shanghai backbone and government networks. Revenue benefits from Chinese government mandates for quantum-safe communications but faces export restrictions and limited international market access.

## 8. Competitive Dynamics and Risk Factors

### QKD vs. PQC: The Central Tension

The quantum-safe security market faces a fundamental strategic question: does QKD or PQC win? In practice, both will coexist, but their relative market shares will depend on several factors:

**PQC Advantages:**
- Software-only: deploys on existing infrastructure, no new hardware needed
- NIST-standardized with broad industry support
- Orders of magnitude cheaper to deploy at scale
- Already shipping in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, iOS, Android, Windows

**QKD Advantages:**
- Information-theoretic security (security based on physics, not computational assumptions)
- Immune to future algorithmic breakthroughs (a PQC algorithm could theoretically be broken)
- Required by some government/military applications where information-theoretic security is mandated

**Likely Outcome:** PQC captures 80%+ of the commercial market; QKD remains a niche for government/defense and ultra-high-security applications. Hybrid QKD+PQC systems (like Toshiba's and SK Telecom's) bridge both markets.

### Key Risk Factors

1. **PQC Algorithm Compromise:** If a NIST-standard PQC algorithm is broken (e.g., a new lattice attack), it would trigger a scramble to backup algorithms (SLH-DSA, HQC) and boost QKD demand. Low probability but high impact.

2. **CRQC Timeline Acceleration:** If cryptographically relevant quantum computers arrive sooner than expected (before 2030), organizations that haven't completed PQC migration face catastrophic data exposure. This would dramatically accelerate PQC spending.

3. **Geopolitical Risk:** China's lead in QKD infrastructure creates supply chain concerns for Western governments. Export controls on quantum technology could fragment the market into China-aligned and Western blocs.

4. **Standards Fragmentation:** Different regions adopting different PQC standards or QKD protocols could create interoperability challenges and market fragmentation.

5. **Vendor Shakeout:** The quantum-safe security space has attracted many small startups with overlapping capabilities. A consolidation phase is likely as large cybersecurity vendors (Palo Alto, CrowdStrike, Fortinet) build or acquire PQC capabilities. IonQ's acquisition spree (Qubitekk, IDQ) signals this consolidation has begun.

6. **Free/Open-Source PQC:** NIST PQC algorithms are freely available and implemented in major open-source libraries (OpenSSL, BoringSSL, liboqs). This commoditizes the algorithm layer, pushing commercial value toward tooling, migration services, and managed platforms rather than algorithm licensing.

---

## 9. Investment Thesis Summary

### Near-Term Opportunity (2025-2028): PQC Migration

The most investable near-term opportunity is PQC migration services and software. CNSA 2.0's January 2027 deadline for new NSS acquisitions creates immediate demand. The $7.1B U.S. federal migration budget provides a visible, government-backed revenue pool. Key beneficiaries: SandboxAQ (if it IPOs), Palo Alto Networks (PQC features), IBM (consulting + Quantum Safe solutions), PQShield (hardware IP).

### Medium-Term Opportunity (2028-2035): Quantum Networking Infrastructure

As quantum repeater technology matures and metropolitan quantum networks expand, infrastructure plays become more attractive. IonQ's vertical integration (computing + networking + security) positions it well if quantum networks scale as projected, but its current valuation prices in significant execution. The EuroQCI rollout (2026-2030) and China's satellite constellation create infrastructure spending tailwinds.

### Avoid/Caution

- **Arqit ($ARQQ):** Revenue of $530K against a $300-420M market cap represents extreme speculative premium. Technology claims require independent validation.
- **Pure QKD hardware plays** face margin pressure from PQC software alternatives and distance limitations.
- **Pre-revenue quantum networking startups** (Aliro) face long timelines to commercial relevance.

### Preferred Exposure

| Timeframe | Approach | Vehicles |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Near-term (2025-2028) | PQC migration demand | Palo Alto ($PANW), IBM ($IBM), SandboxAQ (pre-IPO) |
| Medium-term (2028-2035) | Quantum networking infrastructure | IonQ ($IONQ), Toshiba (6502.T) |
| Thematic exposure | Broad quantum security | Defiance Quantum ETF ($QTUM), emerging quantum security ETFs |
