# Defense & Industrial Demand for Critical Minerals

## Executive Summary

Critical minerals have become the sinews of modern military power and industrial competitiveness. The U.S. Department of Defense consumes 3,000-4,000 tons of rare earth magnets annually, while every major weapons platform — from the F-35 Lightning II to Virginia-class submarines — depends on materials overwhelmingly sourced from China. Simultaneously, the clean energy transition is driving unprecedented demand growth: electric vehicles, wind turbines, and AI data centers are projected to multiply consumption of rare earths, lithium, copper, and specialty metals through 2035. The convergence of military necessity and industrial demand has triggered a historic mobilization of government resources, with the Pentagon executing a $400M equity stake in MP Materials, Congress appropriating $2B for National Defense Stockpile expansion, and allied nations coordinating through the Minerals Security Partnership to build alternative supply chains. This report maps the full landscape of defense and industrial demand, from individual weapons platforms to global supply-demand projections through 2035.

## 1. Military Applications

### 1.1 Major Weapons Platforms

#### F-35 Lightning II

The F-35 is the single most rare-earth-intensive weapons platform in the U.S. arsenal. According to the Congressional Research Service, each aircraft requires approximately **920 pounds (417 kg) of rare earth materials**, distributed across multiple critical subsystems:

| Component | Key Minerals | Function |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Permanent magnet motors | Neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium | Power generation, actuators |
| Engine components | Samarium-cobalt (SmCo) magnets (~50 lbs per aircraft) | High-temperature operation (up to 300C) |
| Targeting systems | Yttrium, terbium | Electro-optical sensors, laser designators |
| Stealth coatings | Various rare earths | Radar-absorbing materials |
| Flight control actuators | NdFeB magnets | Precision fin and surface control |
| Avionics | Gallium arsenide, germanium | High-frequency radar, communications |

Lockheed Martin is the largest U.S. consumer of samarium, with each F-35 containing roughly 50 pounds of SmCo magnets specifically for high-heat environments in the engine and power systems. The F-35 program plans to produce approximately 156 aircraft per year at full rate, implying annual rare earth consumption of roughly 143,520 pounds (65 metric tons) for this single platform alone.

The next-generation air dominance (NGAD) fighter is expected to require even greater quantities of rare earths given its more advanced sensor suites, directed-energy weapon integration, and larger airframe. Delivery delays already plague the F-35 program — average delays stretched from 61 days in 2023 to 238 days in 2024 — and supply chain constraints on rare earth inputs are a contributing factor.

#### Virginia-Class Submarine

Virginia-class nuclear attack submarines represent the most mineral-intensive individual defense platform. Each submarine requires an estimated **9,200 pounds (4.2 metric tons) of rare earth elements**, supporting:

- **Sonar systems**: Terbium-dysprosium-iron (Terfenol-D) alloys for magnetostrictive transducers
- **Propulsion**: Samarium-cobalt magnets in electric drive motors
- **Navigation**: Neodymium magnets in inertial measurement units
- **Weapons systems**: Precision actuators for torpedo and missile launch systems
- **Power generation**: Rare earth permanent magnets in auxiliary power systems
- **Communications**: Gallium arsenide components in radio and satellite systems

Additional critical minerals in submarine construction include cobalt, copper, nickel, and samarium for diesel engines and gas turbine power plants, shafts, and propellers. Advanced submarine batteries now require copper, graphite, silicon, aluminum, cobalt, manganese, and nickel. The Navy's plan to build two Virginia-class submarines per year implies annual rare earth demand of approximately 18,400 pounds (8.4 metric tons) from this program alone.

#### DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-Class Destroyer

Each Arleigh Burke-class destroyer requires substantial rare earth inputs for its Aegis combat system, SPY-1 radar (gallium arsenide components), gas turbine engines (yttrium thermal barrier coatings), and numerous permanent magnet motors throughout the ship. The Navy operates 73 active destroyers and continues to procure additional Flight III variants with more advanced electronics requiring additional rare earth inputs.

### 1.2 Precision-Guided Munitions

Precision-guided munitions represent one of the most volume-sensitive rare earth applications in defense. The U.S. military's consumption of smart weapons has surged — over 50,000 precision-guided munitions were provided to Ukraine and Israel between 2022 and 2025, depleting stockpiles significantly.

**Samarium-Cobalt Magnets in Guided Weapons:**

SmCo magnets are the backbone of precision munition guidance. They enable the miniature motors that manipulate flight control surfaces on guided weapons. Without these magnets, guidance systems would require hydraulic actuators that are three times the size and significantly more expensive.

| Munition | Rare Earth Application | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) | SmCo magnets in fin actuation system | ~25,000 produced annually |
| Tomahawk cruise missile | NdFeB/SmCo magnets in navigation and control | GPS/INS guidance |
| Patriot PAC-3 | Permanent magnets in seeker and actuators | Theater missile defense |
| Javelin ATGM | SmCo magnets in IR seeker cooling, actuators | Man-portable anti-tank |
| Stinger MANPADS | Miniature permanent magnet motors | IR-guided anti-aircraft |
| AMRAAM (AIM-120) | Rare earth magnets in radar seeker and fins | Beyond-visual-range air-to-air |
| SDB (Small Diameter Bomb) | SmCo actuators for precision guidance | GPS/laser guided |

The thermal stability of SmCo magnets (operating range -55C to 300C) makes them irreplaceable for weapons that experience extreme temperature cycling during flight. NdFeB magnets, while stronger, demagnetize above approximately 150C — disqualifying them from many high-speed and high-temperature munition applications.

### 1.3 Specialized Military Materials

#### Night Vision Systems

Lanthanum is essential for night vision optics. Lanthanum oxide glass provides high refractive indices and low dispersion, enabling the lightweight, high-clarity optics required for Generation III and IV night vision goggles. Digital camera lenses used in ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) platforms can be up to 50% lanthanum by weight. The U.S. military maintains hundreds of thousands of night vision devices across all services, with each generation requiring more sophisticated optical materials.

#### Jet Engines and Turbines

Military jet engines are among the most demanding applications for critical minerals:

- **Rhenium**: Approximately 80% of global rhenium production goes to aviation engines. Rhenium-containing nickel superalloys in turbine blades can withstand temperatures above 1,100C. Each F-35 F135 engine contains single-crystal turbine blades with rhenium alloys.
- **Yttrium**: Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coatings protect turbine components from extreme heat, extending engine life and enabling higher operating temperatures.
- **Hafnium**: Used in nickel superalloy turbine blades for its contribution to grain boundary strengthening.

#### Armor and Kinetic Penetrators

- **Tungsten**: Tungsten carbide is used in armor-piercing projectiles (M829 APFSDS tank rounds), armored vehicle composite plating, and kinetic energy penetrators. The U.S. has minimal domestic tungsten production — China supplies approximately 80% of global output.
- **Depleted uranium**: While the U.S. uses DU in some penetrators, tungsten is the preferred material for many NATO allies and increasingly for U.S. systems due to radiological concerns.

#### Military Electronics and Communications

- **Gallium arsenide (GaAs)**: Used in phased-array radar, electronic warfare systems, satellite communications, and high-frequency RF applications. GaAs semiconductors are chosen over silicon for high-power, high-frequency military electronics.
- **Germanium**: Infrared optics for thermal imaging, targeting pods, and missile seekers. Also used in fiber optic communications for military networks.
- **Indium**: Indium tin oxide (ITO) coatings on cockpit displays and head-up displays.

### 1.4 Defense Industrial Base Dependency Map

| Mineral | Primary Military Use | China's Global Share | U.S. Domestic Production |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Neodymium | Permanent magnets (motors, actuators) | ~60% mining, ~90% processing | MP Materials (Mountain Pass) |
| Samarium | High-temp magnets (engines, munitions) | ~60% mining, ~90% processing | Minimal |
| Dysprosium | High-temp magnet additives | ~90% processing | None (until Lynas TX, 2026) |
| Terbium | Sonar transducers, magnets | ~90% processing | None |
| Gallium | Radar, EW systems, semiconductors | ~99% refining | Near-zero |
| Germanium | IR optics, fiber optics | ~60% refining | Recycling only |
| Rhenium | Jet engine superalloys | ~50% (Chile leads mining) | Byproduct from molybdenum |
| Tungsten | Armor, penetrators, tooling | ~80% mining and processing | Near-zero (closed mines) |
| Cobalt | Superalloys, batteries | ~75% mining (DRC), ~80% refining (China) | Minimal byproduct |
| Lanthanum | Night vision optics, catalysts | ~60% mining, ~90% processing | MP Materials (mixed) |

The U.S. military consumes approximately 3,000-4,000 tons of rare earth magnets annually. China refines over 85% of global rare earths and produces nearly 90% of high-performance permanent magnets, creating a single-point-of-failure in the defense supply chain.

## 2. Electric Vehicles and Clean Energy

### 2.1 NdFeB Permanent Magnets in EV Motors

Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) using neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets dominate the EV motor market, representing over 86% of EV traction motors in 2024 and 96% of all rare earth magnet demand in 2025.

**Rare Earth Content Per Vehicle:**

| Category | NdFeB Magnet Weight | NdPr Oxide Content | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Typical BEV (single motor) | 1.0-2.0 kg | 0.5-0.7 kg | Standard efficiency |
| Dual-motor BEV | 2.0-4.0 kg | 1.0-1.4 kg | Performance/AWD models |
| Total RE content (motor + other) | ~10 kg per vehicle | Various | Includes battery, electronics |
| Industry average (magnets only) | ~1.5 kg | ~0.7 kg NdPr oxide | 7.5g per kW of drivetrain power |

**Demand by Manufacturer:**

Different automakers have varying rare earth strategies:

- **Tesla**: Moved to rare-earth-free motors for Model 3 Highland rear motor (switched reluctance/induction), but still uses NdFeB in front motor of dual-motor variants. Announced intent to eliminate rare earths entirely from next-generation vehicles.
- **BMW**: iX and i4 use fifth-generation eDrive with NdFeB magnets. Investing in recycling partnerships.
- **Toyota/Lexus**: Developed motors using 50% less rare earths through grain boundary diffusion technology. Hybrid models (300,000+ NdFeB motors annually) remain major consumers.
- **BYD**: Vertically integrated supply from Chinese rare earth sources. Blade Battery + PMSM architecture uses 1-2 kg NdFeB per vehicle.
- **GM (Ultium)**: Uses permanent magnet motors with NdFeB. Investing in MP Materials supply agreements.
- **Hyundai/Kia**: E-GMP platform uses PMSM with ~1.5 kg magnets. Exploring reluctance motor alternatives.

**Demand Scale:**

With global EV sales reaching approximately 17 million units in 2024 and projected to reach 30+ million by 2030, EV motors are expected to drive 30-40% of rare earth demand growth over the next decade. At an average of 0.7 kg NdPr oxide per vehicle, 30 million EVs would require approximately 21,000 metric tons of NdPr oxide annually — roughly 50% of current global NdPr production.

### 2.2 Wind Turbine Generators

Wind energy is a major and growing consumer of rare earth permanent magnets, driven by the shift from geared to direct-drive generator architectures.

**Direct Drive vs. Geared Turbines:**

| Type | NdFeB Content | Advantages | Key Manufacturers |
|------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Direct Drive (DD-PMSG) | 500-700 kg per MW | No gearbox (fewer moving parts), higher reliability, lower O&M | GE Vernova (Haliade-X), Siemens Gamesa (SG 14-236 DD) |
| Geared (DFIG) | 0 kg (no magnets) | Lower upfront RE cost, mature technology | Vestas (V236-15.0 MW uses geared) |
| Geared + PM Generator | 100-200 kg per MW | Compromise design, smaller magnets | Some medium-speed designs |

A single GE Haliade-X 13 MW offshore direct-drive turbine requires approximately 4,000-6,000 kg (4-6 metric tons) of NdFeB magnets. The global offshore wind pipeline exceeds 300 GW through 2035, representing potential magnet demand of hundreds of thousands of metric tons.

**Market Dynamics:**

- NdFeB magnets represent 96% of rare earth magnet demand globally in 2025
- IDTechEx projects wind energy and robotics will be the highest growth applications, driving overall magnet demand to increase 1.69x by 2036
- More than 90% of EU permanent magnets for wind turbines currently come from China
- The EU's Resilience Roadmap sets aspirational targets for sourcing permanent magnets from non-Chinese suppliers by 2029-2035
- WindEurope reports that European turbine OEMs are actively seeking to qualify alternative magnet suppliers

### 2.3 Alternative Motor Designs Reducing Rare Earth Dependency

The automotive industry is actively developing rare-earth-free motor technologies, driven by supply chain risk and cost considerations:

**Switched Reluctance Motors (SRM):**
- Produce torque through magnetic attraction of steel rotor to stator electromagnets — no permanent magnets required
- Use only electrical steel, copper, and iron
- Canadian startup Enedym has received investment from Honda's Xcelerator Ventures
- Trade-offs: higher noise, more torque ripple, roughly half the torque density of PMSM
- Currently ~5% of new EV motors; share could triple by 2037

**Synchronous Reluctance Motors (SynRM):**
- Eliminate rare earth magnets while maintaining reasonable power density
- Being actively developed for EV applications by multiple OEMs

**Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors:**
- Used in Renault Zoe and some BMW models
- Replace permanent magnets with electromagnet rotor
- Slightly lower efficiency but eliminates rare earth dependency

**Induction Motors:**
- Used by Tesla (original Model S/X, some Model 3/Y variants)
- No permanent magnets; uses copper or aluminum rotor cage
- Slightly less efficient than PMSM at partial loads

**Astemo (Hitachi)** announced in October 2025 a new rare-earth-free motor for BEVs, and the broader industry trend is clear: demand for rare-earth-free motors will grow at roughly 15% per year over the next decade. However, in 2025, approximately 95% of new EV motors still use rare earth magnets, and the transition will be gradual.

## 3. Electronics and Technology

### 3.1 Consumer Electronics

More than 30 elements are used to build a single smartphone, with critical minerals embedded throughout:

| Component | Key Minerals | Amount Per Device |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Camera lenses | Lanthanum compounds | 0.5-2.0 grams |
| Display (LCD/OLED) | Gallium, europium, terbium, yttrium, indium | Trace amounts |
| Speakers/vibration | Neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium | ~1-2 grams (NdFeB magnets) |
| Battery | Lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese | 5-10 grams Li, 5-10g Co |
| Circuit boards | Copper, gold, silver, palladium, tantalum | Various |
| Memory/storage | Gallium (GaAs), germanium | Trace |

With approximately 1.4 billion smartphones sold annually and 250+ million laptops, consumer electronics represent steady baseline demand for critical minerals. Laptops and computers additionally use rare earths in hard drive magnets (neodymium), display phosphors (europium, cerium), and cooling fan motors.

### 3.2 Semiconductor Manufacturing

The semiconductor industry depends on several critical minerals now subject to geopolitical tensions:

**Gallium:**
- Gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN) are essential for high-performance chips used in 5G infrastructure, defense radar, and RF applications
- GaN semiconductors increasingly chosen over silicon for high-power, high-frequency applications
- China controls approximately 99% of global refined gallium production
- China imposed export restrictions in December 2024, then temporarily suspended them through November 2026 following the Trump-Xi summit
- USGS estimates a total export ban on gallium and germanium could cause a $3.4 billion U.S. GDP loss

**Germanium:**
- Critical for infrared optics (military thermal imaging), fiber optic communications, and advanced semiconductor substrates
- China produces roughly 60% of global refined germanium
- Subject to same export control regime as gallium
- Essential for next-generation SiGe (silicon-germanium) chips used in 5G and radar

**High-Purity Silicon:**
- Semiconductor-grade polysilicon (11N purity) is the foundation of the chip industry
- While silicon is abundant, ultra-high-purity processing is concentrated in a few locations
- Increasing demand from AI accelerator chips (massive die sizes)

### 3.3 AI and Data Center Buildout

The explosive growth of AI infrastructure is creating a new, massive vector of critical mineral demand:

**Copper:**
- S&P Global projects total copper demand will surge from 28 million metric tons in 2025 to 42 million metric tons by 2040
- Data center copper demand specifically forecast to increase from 1.1 million metric tons in 2025 to 2.5 million metric tons by 2040
- AI training data centers will account for 58% of total data center copper demand by 2030
- AI-related copper consumption could exceed 500,000 metric tons annually by 2030 (~2% of global production)
- International Copper Study Group expects a refined copper shortfall of ~150,000 tonnes in 2026
- Wood Mackenzie forecasts a 304,000-tonne refined-copper deficit in 2025, widening in 2026
- S&P Global warns of a potential 10 million metric ton supply deficit by 2040

**Rare Earths in Data Centers:**
- Server cooling fans use NdFeB permanent magnet motors
- Hard drives contain neodymium magnets (though SSDs are reducing this demand)
- Power supply and UPS systems use permanent magnet motors
- A single hyperscale data center can contain hundreds of thousands of server fans

**Other Critical Materials:**
- Cobalt, lithium, nickel for backup battery systems (UPS)
- Silver for electrical contacts and photovoltaic power
- Indium for display technologies and transparent conductors
- Tantalum for high-performance capacitors

## 4. National Defense Stockpile (NDS)

### 4.1 Historical Context

The National Defense Stockpile was established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act of 1939 and expanded massively during the Cold War. At its peak, the stockpile held an inflation-adjusted **$42 billion** in critical reserves, covering dozens of strategic materials. Following the end of the Cold War, successive administrations drew down the stockpile through sales, using proceeds to fund other priorities. By the early 2020s, the NDS had been reduced to a shadow of its former self.

### 4.2 Current Status

As of 2023-2024, the National Defense Stockpile contains approximately **$1.3 billion in total assets**, including $912.3 million of stockpiled material. The stockpile:

- Mitigates less than half of estimated strategic and critical materials shortfalls for military requirements
- Covers less than 10% of essential critical materials shortfalls
- Lacks usable quantities of rare earth materials needed for rapid defense production
- Contains primarily legacy materials (beryllium, chromium, cobalt, manganese, titanium, tungsten, zinc) that may not align with modern defense needs

This represents a more than 95% decline in real value from Cold War levels.

### 4.3 Modernization Funding

Congress and the executive branch have authorized historic new funding to rebuild the stockpile:

| Legislation/Action | Amount | Purpose | Timeline |
|-------------------|--------|---------|----------|
| One Big Beautiful Act (FY2025) | $2.0 billion | NDS expansion through critical mineral purchases | Spending by 2026-2027 |
| Industrial Base Fund | $5.0 billion | Critical minerals supply chain support | Multi-year |
| Office of Strategic Capital (DOD) | $500 million | Loans and loan guarantees to critical mineral firms | Through 2027 |
| Pentagon Procurement (2025) | Up to $1 billion | Direct mineral purchases | 2025-2026 |

This represents the largest strategic mineral acquisition effort since the Cold War.

**Materials Targeted for Stockpiling:**

Based on DOD Requests for Information (RFIs), the stockpile is prioritizing:
- Rare earth elements: samarium, dysprosium, terbium, neodymium, praseodymium
- Minerals with known domestic deposits but insufficient production: scandium, tungsten, graphite
- Battery materials: lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese
- Semiconductor materials: gallium, germanium

### 4.4 Comparison with Chinese Strategic Reserves

| Dimension | United States | China |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Stockpile value | ~$1.3 billion (pre-2025 expansion) | Unknown (state secret); estimated multi-billion dollar |
| Materials held | ~12 materials (legacy-heavy) | 14+ minerals including aluminum, antimony, cadmium, cobalt, gallium, germanium, indium, molybdenum, rare earths, tantalum, tin, tungsten, zirconium |
| Reserve depth | Less than half of shortfall requirements | Estimated 35-133% of annual domestic demand |
| Operational agency | DLA Strategic Materials | National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration |
| Transparency | Public (annual reports to Congress) | Classified (size and strategy are state secrets) |
| Recent trend | Major expansion authorized ($2B+) | Active accumulation, particularly of copper and battery metals |
| Processing capability | Minimal domestic (building) | 85%+ of global rare earth processing |

The contrast is stark: China has maintained and expanded its strategic reserves while controlling the global processing infrastructure, while the U.S. allowed its stockpile to atrophy for three decades and lost nearly all domestic processing capability.

## 5. Defense Production Act Title III

### 5.1 Authority and Scope

Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) authorizes the President to provide financial incentives — including direct purchases, purchase commitments, loans, and loan guarantees — to expand domestic productive capacity for materials essential to national defense. Sections 301 and 302 specifically authorize loans and loan guarantees to reduce shortfalls in industrial resources, critical technology items, and essential materials.

### 5.2 Major Investments (2023-2026)

The most significant DPA Title III investment in critical minerals came on July 10, 2025, when the DOD executed a landmark deal with **MP Materials**:

| Component | Amount | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| DOD equity stake in MP Materials | $400 million | 15% ownership — DOD becomes largest shareholder |
| Office of Strategic Capital loan | $150 million | Heavy rare earth separation plant at Mountain Pass, CA |
| Price floor guarantee | Ongoing | $110/kg floor for NdPr oxide; guaranteed purchase of all magnets for 10 years |
| 10X Facility | Multi-billion (private + public) | Second magnet manufacturing facility, commissioning ~2028 |
| Production target | 10,000 MT/year | Total U.S. rare earth magnet capacity once 10X Facility operational |

This partnership is unprecedented — the first time the U.S. government has taken a major equity position in a critical minerals company. It was brokered by J.P. Morgan and represents a paradigm shift from arms-length procurement to direct industrial policy.

**Other DPA-Funded Projects:**

| Company | Investment | Mineral/Product | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Lynas Rare Earths | DOD contract + site support | Heavy rare earth separation (TX facility) | Operational 2026 |
| Energy Fuels | DOE-supported | Rare earth oxide from monazite sands | Produced commercial NdPr in 2025 |
| Perpetua Resources | DPA Title III commitment | Antimony (Stibnite Gold Project, Idaho) | Permitting |
| Albemarle | DFC/DOE support | Lithium processing expansion | Under construction |

### 5.3 Executive Actions

**March 2025 Executive Order** — "Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production":
- Reduced DPA approval and notification requirements for mineral projects
- Directed the Department of War (renamed from DOD) and the DFC to create a joint mineral investment fund
- Expanded the definition of minerals eligible for DPA Title III support
- Accelerated permitting for domestic mining and processing

### 5.4 Interagency Coordination

Critical minerals policy involves at least five federal agencies:

| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| Department of War (DOD) | DPA Title III, NDS, procurement, industrial base assessments |
| Department of Energy (DOE) | Processing R&D, recycling, $355M+ in critical minerals production grants, $134M for rare earth supply chains |
| Department of Interior (DOI) | Mining permits, USGS geological surveys, mineral assessments |
| Department of Commerce | Export controls, trade agreements, critical minerals list |
| DFC (Development Finance Corporation) | International project financing, bilateral investment deals |

The DOD conducts formal Industrial Base Assessments for critical minerals, evaluating supply chain vulnerabilities and identifying points of single-source dependency. These assessments directly inform DPA Title III investment priorities.

| Gallium | ~700 MT | ~1,000+ MT | ~1,500+ MT | GaN chips, 5G, defense | CRITICAL — 99% China production |
| Germanium | ~180 MT | ~250+ MT | ~300+ MT | IR optics, fiber, SiGe chips | HIGH — 60% China production |
| Tungsten | ~95,000 MT | ~110,000+ MT | ~130,000+ MT | Armor, tooling, electronics | HIGH — 80% China production |

### 7.2 By End-Use Sector

| Sector | 2025 Share of Critical Mineral Demand | 2030 Projection | 2035 Projection | Growth Rate |
|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Electric Vehicles | ~35% of RE magnet demand | ~45% | ~50% | 15-20% CAGR |
| Wind Energy | ~15% of RE magnet demand | ~18% | ~22% | 10-12% CAGR |
| Defense | ~8% of RE demand | ~10% | ~12% | 5-8% CAGR |
| Consumer Electronics | ~20% of RE demand | ~18% | ~15% | 3-5% CAGR (declining share) |
| Data Centers/AI | ~5% of copper demand | ~8-10% | ~12-15% | 20%+ CAGR |
| Grid/Energy Storage | ~10% of lithium demand | ~20% | ~30% | 25%+ CAGR |

### 7.3 Supply-Demand Gap Analysis

**Critical Supply Gaps by 2035 (IEA Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2025):**

| Mineral | Projected Gap | Risk Factor |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Copper | 30% supply shortfall vs. projected demand | Declining ore grades, rising project costs, slow new discoveries |
| Lithium | 38-40% gap by 2035 | Rapid demand growth outpacing new mine development |
| Rare Earths (total) | Potential 60-kiloton shortage (~30% of demand) | Concentrated processing, slow Western buildout |
| Graphite | Significant gap if China excluded | 80%+ Chinese battery-grade production |
| Gallium | Near-total dependency | 99% Chinese production |

**Concentration Risk:**
If the largest single supplier (China for most minerals, Indonesia for nickel) is excluded from supply projections, remaining global production would cover only 35-40% of demand for graphite and rare earth elements by 2035.

### 7.4 Price Sensitivity and Substitution Thresholds

| Mineral | Approximate Price Threshold for Substitution | Alternative Technology |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| NdPr oxide | >$150/kg sustained | Ferrite magnets, SRM motors (50% torque density loss) |
| Dysprosium | >$500/kg sustained | Grain boundary diffusion (50% reduction), new alloy compositions |
| Lithium (Li2CO3) | >$40,000/MT sustained | Sodium-ion batteries (lower energy density) |
| Cobalt | >$80,000/MT sustained | LFP cathodes (already happening — LFP now >60% of China market) |
| Copper | >$15,000/MT sustained | Aluminum conductors (30% conductivity loss), fiber optics for data |
| Gallium | >$1,000/kg sustained | Silicon-based alternatives (lower performance) |
| Tungsten | >$50,000/MT sustained | Hardened steel, ceramic composites (inferior performance) |

Substitution is technically possible for most minerals but comes with significant performance penalties. For defense applications, where performance requirements are non-negotiable, substitution thresholds are effectively unreachable — the military must secure supply regardless of price.
