# Critical Mineral Mining & Extraction: The Foundation of Strategic Supply Chains

## Executive Summary

Critical mineral mining stands at the intersection of national security, energy transition economics, and geopolitical competition. The sector encompasses rare earth elements (REEs), lithium, copper, cobalt, and nickel -- commodities whose demand trajectories are being reshaped by electrification, defense modernization, and the AI infrastructure buildout. Following the "Lithium Winter" of 2024-2025, prices across multiple commodities have stabilized or rebounded, while supply concentration risks have intensified. China's tightening export controls on rare earths, the DRC's cobalt export quota system, and Indonesia's nickel processing dominance create a fragmented supply landscape where Western miners face both enormous opportunity and structural disadvantage. The global rare earth market is valued at approximately $7-14 billion (2025), the lithium market at $44 billion and growing at 18% CAGR, and the copper market is projected to enter structural deficit starting in 2026 with an estimated 150,000-330,000 tonne shortfall. For investors, the critical minerals mining sector represents a generational opportunity tempered by commodity price volatility, permitting risk, and the 15-20 year timeline from discovery to production.

## 1. Rare Earth Miners

### Overview

Rare earth elements are a group of 17 metallic elements essential to permanent magnets, defense systems, wind turbines, and electric vehicle motors. China dominates global REE production (~60%) and processing (~90%), creating acute supply chain vulnerability for Western economies. The non-Chinese rare earth mining sector is concentrated among a handful of companies racing to build vertically integrated supply chains.

### MP Materials (NYSE: MP)

**The Western Hemisphere's Rare Earth Champion**

MP Materials operates the Mountain Pass mine in California, the only scaled rare earth mine and processing facility in the Western Hemisphere. The company has undergone a dramatic transformation from a commodity concentrate seller to a vertically integrated magnet manufacturer.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Cap | ~$10.0B (Feb 2026) |
| Q3 2025 Revenue | $53.6M ($31.6M Materials + $21.9M Magnetics) |
| Q3 2025 REO Production | 13,254 MT (second-best quarterly) |
| Q3 2025 NdPr Production | 721 MT (record; +51% YoY, +21% QoQ) |
| Stock Performance | +230% in 2025 |
| Key Customers | DoD, Apple, GM |

**Vertical Integration Strategy:**
- **Stage 1 (Operational):** Mountain Pass mine produces rare earth oxide concentrate
- **Stage 2 (Ramping):** On-site separation produces individual rare earth oxides, with record NdPr output
- **Stage 3 (Commissioning):** Independence Facility in Fort Worth, TX produces NdPr metal, alloy, and NdFeB permanent magnets -- targeting 10,000 MT/year of finished magnets
- **Stage 4 (Mid-2026):** Heavy rare earth (Dy/Tb) separation circuit at Mountain Pass with 200 MT/year nameplate capacity

**Strategic Positioning:**
MP ceased all product sales to China in alignment with Department of War agreements in Q3 2025, resulting in zero rare earth concentrate revenue for the quarter. This reflects a fundamental pivot toward domestic/allied supply chains. The DoD purchase price agreement commenced October 1, 2025, and Apple provided a $40M prepayment. Management guided for a return to profitability in Q4 2025 as magnet revenues scale.

**Investment Thesis:** MP is the most advanced non-Chinese vertically integrated REE company. The $10B market cap reflects substantial growth expectations. Key risks include NdPr price volatility, magnet factory execution, and competition from emerging Australian/Canadian producers.

### Lynas Rare Earths (ASX: LYC / OTC: LYSCF)

**The Global Scale Alternative to China**

Lynas is the largest rare earth mining and processing company outside China, operating the Mt Weld mine in Western Australia and separation facilities in Malaysia.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Cap | ~A$15.7B (~$10B USD, Jan 2026) |
| FY2025 Revenue | A$556.5M (+20% YoY) |
| FY2026E Revenue | ~A$1.1B (consensus; ~2x growth) |
| Current REO Capacity | ~7,000 t/year |
| Target NdPr Capacity | 10,500-12,000 t/year (~20% of non-Chinese supply) |
| Q1 FY2026 REO Output | 3,993 tonnes (+47% YoY) |

**Operational Footprint:**
- **Mt Weld (Australia):** Open-pit mine with one of the highest-grade rare earth deposits globally. Expansion to 10,500-12,000 t/year NdPr oxide underway.
- **Kuantan (Malaysia):** Rare earth separation and processing plant. Lynas announced plans to build a new heavy REE separation facility in Malaysia (~A$180M, 5,000 t/year capacity).
- **Seadrift, Texas (Uncertain):** DoD-funded heavy rare earth processing facility faces significant permitting challenges related to wastewater management. As of November 2025, the company said the project is unlikely to proceed in its current form.

**Investment Thesis:** Lynas offers the largest non-Chinese production scale and strong NdPr pricing leverage. The Texas facility uncertainty is a setback for US supply chain ambitions. FY2026 consensus revenue of ~A$1.1B (doubling YoY) reflects NdPr price recovery and volume growth. Market cap has risen 160% in one year.

### Energy Fuels (NYSE American: UUUU)

**The Dual-Commodity Strategic Play**

Energy Fuels occupies a unique niche as the only US company commercially producing both uranium and rare earth elements, positioning it at the nexus of two critical national security supply chains.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Cap | ~$5.0B (Feb 2026) |
| FY2025 Uranium Production | >1,000,000 lbs U3O8 |
| NdPr Oxide Capacity | Up to 1,000 t/year (from monazite) |
| Dy Oxide (Pilot) | ~29 kg produced at 99.9% purity |
| Future Dy Capacity | 48 MT/year (commercial, by Q4-2026) |
| Future Tb Capacity | 14 MT/year (commercial, by Q4-2026) |
| Working Capital | ~$1B (post convertible note offering) |

**Rare Earth Processing at White Mesa Mill:**
Energy Fuels processes monazite sand (mined in Florida and Georgia) at its White Mesa Mill in Utah, the only conventional uranium mill operating in the US. The company can process up to 10,000 tonnes of monazite concentrate annually.

Key milestones achieved in 2025:
- First kg of 99.9% purity dysprosium oxide (August 2025)
- Heavy REE oxide qualified for use in permanent magnets (NdFeB)
- US-mined and processed rare earths manufactured into permanent magnets for EVs
- Poised to produce 6 of 7 rare earth oxides subject to Chinese export controls

**Investment Thesis:** UUUU offers dual exposure to uranium and rare earths, both benefiting from US critical minerals policy. The $700M convertible note offering and ~$1B working capital provide ample runway. Key risk is the commodity price environment for both uranium and REEs simultaneously.

### Texas Mineral Resources (OTC: TMRC)

**Early-Stage Heavy Rare Earth Optionality**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Cap | <$50M |
| Ownership in Round Top | ~18.7% (declining via dilution) |
| Project Stage | Pre-production; pilot dysprosium produced |
| Operating Partner | USA Rare Earth (USARE) |
| Government Support | $1.6B LOI with US government (Jan 2026) |

TMRC holds a minority stake in the Round Top Heavy-Rare Earth Project in West Texas. The project contains a large deposit of heavy rare earths (Dy, Tb, Y) and lithium. USA Rare Earth, the operating partner, secured a $1.6B letter of intent with the US government in January 2026.

**Risks:** TMRC faces severe dilution risk, acknowledging insufficient capital to fund fiscal 2026 cash calls. The stock trades as a speculative option on Round Top's development.

## 2. Lithium Miners

### Overview

Lithium is the irreplaceable cathode material for lithium-ion batteries powering EVs, grid storage, and consumer electronics. The global lithium market reached approximately $44 billion in 2025 and is projected to grow at ~18% CAGR to ~$75 billion by 2030. After the brutal "Lithium Winter" of 2024-2025 -- characterized by price collapses from ~$80,000/tonne to under $10,000/tonne for lithium carbonate -- prices stabilized around $18,500/tonne by early 2026. Global demand is projected to exceed 1.7 million MT LCE by 2026 (SQM estimate), with production reaching 1.5 million MT by 2030.

### Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB)

**The World's Largest Lithium Producer**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Cap | ~$19.2B (Feb 2026) |
| FY2025 Revenue | ~$4.9B |
| Adjusted EBITDA Margin | ~25% (recovering) |
| Cost Reductions | $450M annual operating cost savings achieved |
| Stock Recovery | ~90% from 2025 lows |
| Key Operations | Chile (brine), Silver Peak NV (brine), Talison JV (hard rock), Wodgina JV (hard rock) |

**Operational Footprint:**
- **Chile:** Salar de Atacama brine operations (largest lithium brine deposit globally)
- **Silver Peak, Nevada:** US brine operation (only active lithium brine operation in North America)
- **Talison (Greenbushes), Australia:** 49% JV with Tianqi Lithium; world's largest hard-rock lithium mine
- **Wodgina, Australia:** JV with Mineral Resources
- **Kings Mountain, North Carolina:** Restart of historic spodumene mine; designated as critical mineral project with streamlined permitting potential and potential low-interest government loans

**Investment Thesis:** Albemarle is the bellwether for lithium. The $4.9B revenue base, cost restructuring, and leverage to lithium price recovery make it the institutional-grade lithium play. Kings Mountain restart is a multi-year catalyst. Key risk is another lithium price downturn if EV adoption slows.

### Arcadium Lithium (Acquired by Rio Tinto)

**Now Part of the World's Second-Largest Miner**

Rio Tinto completed its $6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium Lithium in March 2025, creating one of the world's largest lithium producers.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Acquisition Price | $6.7B |
| Current LCE Capacity | 75,000 t/year |
| 2028 Target Capacity | >200,000 t/year LCE |
| Key Brine Assets | Salar del Hombre Muerto, Olaroz, Sal de Vida, Cauchari (Argentina) |
| Hard Rock | Mt Cattlin (care & maintenance since March 2025) |

The Arcadium acquisition gave Rio Tinto a dominant position in Argentina's Lithium Triangle and Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology. Mt Cattlin hard-rock mine entered care and maintenance due to low lithium prices but represents optionality in a price recovery scenario.

**Investor Implications:** Arcadium is no longer publicly traded. Exposure is via Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO / ASX: RIO), which now targets 200,000+ t/year LCE by 2028 from Tier 1 brine assets.

### SQM - Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE: SQM)

**Chile's Lithium King**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Cap | ~$20.4B (Feb 2026) |

| Current LiOH Capacity | 35,000 MT (expanding to 100,000 MT) |
| Current Li2CO3 Capacity | 185,000 MT (expanding to 240,000 MT by 2026) |
| Expansion CapEx | $2.7B over 3 years |
| 2026 Demand Forecast | >1.7M MT LCE globally |

**Codelco-SQM Partnership (Nova Andino Litio):**
The landmark JV between SQM and state-owned Codelco restructures Salar de Atacama lithium production through 2060. The Chilean state (via Codelco, CORFO, and Treasury) receives ~70% of operating margin from new production (2025-2030), rising to 85% from 2031. SQM's current CORFO lease expires December 31, 2030.

**Investment Thesis:** SQM offers the lowest-cost lithium production globally (brine extraction in the Atacama) and massive scale-up plans. The Codelco partnership provides regulatory certainty through 2060 but significantly increases the state's economic take. Record Q3 2025 lithium sales volumes signal demand recovery.

### Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS)

**Australia's Hard-Rock Lithium Leader**

| FY2026 Unit Costs | $560-600/t (down from $627/t in FY25) |
| FY2026 CapEx | $300-330M |
| Key Asset | Pilgangoora, Western Australia |

**Pilgangoora Operation:**
Pilgangoora is one of the world's largest hard-rock lithium deposits. The P680 and P1000 expansion projects drove record production in FY2025. Mineral resources upgraded 23% in FY2025.

**BMX Auction Platform:**
Pilbara operates the Battery Material Exchange (BMX), a digital auction platform for spodumene concentrate that provides real-time price discovery and transparency to the lithium market.

**Investment Thesis:** PLS offers pure-play hard-rock lithium exposure with declining unit costs, production growth, and strong resource optionality. The BMX platform provides unique market intelligence. Rebranded to "PLS Group" in late 2025 to reflect diversification ambitions.

- Late 2027: Phase 1 mechanical completion target

**GM Offtake:** GM can purchase up to 100% of Phase 1 production and up to 38% of total Thacker Pass production for 20 years.

**Investment Thesis:** LAC is a pre-revenue development play with significant government backing ($1.97B DOE loan) and GM partnership. Phase 1 at 40,000 t/year would make it the largest lithium producer in North America. Key risks are construction execution, lithium price at time of production, and the $1.6B market cap reflecting significant upside/downside optionality.

### Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL)

**Now a Subsidiary of Sayona Mining**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Cap | ~$160-200M (Feb 2026) |
| NC Production Target | 2026 start |
| Combined US Capacity | 60,000 t/year (NC + TN plants) |
| Tesla Offtake | 125,000 MT SC6/year (through 2025, renewable) |
| Corporate Status | Subsidiary of Sayona Mining (since Aug 2025) |

Piedmont secured its North Carolina state mining permit and posted a $1M reclamation bond. The NC mine and Tennessee hydroxide plant (30,000 t/year LiOH) aim to begin production in 2025-2026. The company was acquired by Sayona Mining in August 2025, reducing its standalone investment profile.

## 3. Copper Mining

### Overview

Copper is increasingly called "the new oil" due to its irreplaceable role in electrification, power grids, EVs, data centers, and renewable energy infrastructure. The International Copper Study Group (ICSG) projects a surplus of ~178,000 tonnes in 2025 transitioning to a deficit of 150,000 tonnes in 2026. J.P. Morgan projects a larger 2026 deficit of ~330,000 MT. BloombergNEF analysis indicates copper may enter structural deficit through the 2030s as demand growth outpaces new supply. Goldman Sachs predicts that by 2030, global power grid and infrastructure construction will contribute 60% of copper demand growth.

**Price Forecasts:**
- Bank of America: ~$11,313/tonne average in 2026, ~$13,501/tonne in 2027
- Goldman Sachs: $15,000/tonne by 2035 (real terms)
- Copper market growth: +$82.2B at ~7% CAGR from 2025-2030

### Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX)

**The World's Largest Publicly Traded Copper Producer**

## 4. Cobalt & Nickel Supply Chains

### Cobalt: From Oversupply to Strategic Scarcity

**DRC Dominance:**
The Democratic Republic of Congo produces roughly 75% of global mined cobalt. Two companies dominate:

| Company | 2024 DRC Production | Global Market Share |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| CMOC Group (China) | 114,165 MT | ~31% global (2024) |
| Glencore (Switzerland) | ~50,000 MT | ~15% global |
| **Combined** | **~164,000 MT** | **~46% global** |

Together, CMOC and Glencore control ~60% of DRC cobalt exports and ~70% combined when including smaller DRC producers.

**Artisanal Mining Collapse:**
Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in the DRC dropped to a historic low of <2% of production in 2024, down from 15-20% historically. Industrial mining has scaled to the point where ASM is unlikely to recover its market share even if prices rise.

**DRC Export Controls:**
The DRC imposed a cobalt export ban in February 2025, later replaced by export quotas of 96,000 MT/year for 2026-2027 -- approximately half of 2024 export volumes. The government is building a strategic stockpile of 9,600 t/year. This intervention has been dramatic:

| Metric | Before (Early 2025) | After (Late 2025) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Cobalt Metal Price | ~$21,500/tonne | ~$56,400/tonne |
| Market Balance | Deep oversupply | Projected 2026 deficit |
| Price Change | -- | +162% |

**US Strategic Response:** The Department of Defense plans to purchase ~7,480 tonnes of alloy-grade cobalt over five years for strategic reserves (up to $500M procurement).

### Nickel: The Indonesian Flood

**Supply Surplus:**
The nickel market faces persistent oversupply driven by Indonesian production:

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 (Projected) |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Global Surplus | ~212,000 tonnes | ~288,000 tonnes |
| Indonesia Share of Global Output | ~60% | Growing |
| Indonesian MHP Capacity | -- | 862,000 t/year (nearly doubling) |
| Indonesian Production Utilization | 55% (vs. quotas) | Under review |

**HPAL Processing:**
High-Pressure Acid Leach (HPAL) technology enables conversion of low-grade Indonesian laterite ores into battery-grade nickel. Several new HPAL plants are scheduled for commissioning in 2026. However, the process generates 1.4-1.6 tonnes of waste per tonne of nickel produced and faces intensifying environmental scrutiny.

**Environmental Concerns:**
- HPAL operations require intensive acid use and complex tailings management
- Indonesian nickel processing relies heavily on coal-fired power, creating high carbon intensity
- Indonesia's government plans to cut nickel production in 2026 to support prices and crack down on environmentally harmful operations

**Investor Implications:** Nickel's structural surplus weighs on miners (e.g., Vale, BHP nickel divisions). The market may not rebalance until Indonesian production cuts materialize or demand from next-generation batteries (high-nickel cathodes) accelerates.

## 5. New Mine Development Timelines & Permitting

### The 15-20 Year Challenge

Developing a new mine from initial discovery to first production has historically taken 15-20 years in developed economies, driven by:
- Geological exploration and resource delineation (2-5 years)
- Environmental Impact Statements under NEPA (1-3+ years)
- Federal, state, and local permitting processes (3-7 years)
- NEPA litigation delays (1-5+ years)
- Financing and construction (3-5 years)

### Trump Administration Permitting Acceleration (2025)

The Trump administration has implemented unprecedented changes to expedite critical mineral mining:

**Executive Order: "Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production" (March 2025)**
- Opens essentially all federal lands to mining as a priority use
- Provides immediate government funding for new mines and processing facilities
- Directs expedited permitting for new or expanded operations

**NEPA Overhaul:**
- Environmental assessments (typically ~1 year) reduced to ~14 days under emergency procedures
- Full Environmental Impact Statements (typically ~2 years) reduced to ~28 days
- Council on Environmental Quality ordered to rescind all NEPA regulations

**Defense Production Act (DPA) Expansion:**
- Reduced approval and notification requirements for critical minerals
- DOW and DFC directed to create joint mineral investment fund
- Multiple authorities traditionally reserved for the president delegated to DFC

**Congressional Funding (One Big Beautiful Bill Act):**
- $2B for FY2025 National Defense Stockpile expansion (critical minerals purchases)
- $5B to Industrial Base Fund for critical minerals supply chain support
- Critical minerals designated for faster permitting under IRA/DPA provisions

### International Permitting Landscape

**Canada:** Progressive assessment framework but First Nations consultation requirements and environmental reviews still require 5-10+ years for major projects.

**Australia:** State-level approvals generally faster than US (3-7 years), supported by government financing (e.g., Iluka's A$1.65B non-recourse loan, Arafura's AU$200M NRF commitment).

**Chile:** CORFO partnership model provides regulatory certainty for brine operations but increasing state economic participation (70-85% of operating margin).

## Key Investment Themes

1. **Vertical Integration Premium:** Companies building mine-to-magnet (MP Materials) or mine-to-cathode supply chains command valuation premiums as geopolitical risk pricing accelerates.

2. **Government as Customer and Financier:** The US government is simultaneously the largest customer (DoD purchase agreements), financier (DOE loans, DPA authorities, IRA tax credits), and regulator (NEPA reform). This creates policy-dependent investment thesis for domestic miners.

3. **The Lithium Recovery Trade:** After the 2024-2025 price collapse, lithium equities have recovered significantly (ALB +90%, PLS recovering). The question is whether $18,500/tonne lithium carbonate is sustainable or a temporary rebound.

4. **Copper's Structural Deficit:** With 150,000-330,000 tonne deficits projected for 2026 and structural undersupply through the 2030s, copper miners (FCX, SCCO) offer commodity price leverage on the energy transition.

5. **Cobalt's OPEC Moment:** The DRC's export quota system (+162% price impact) demonstrates sovereign resource power. This creates both opportunity (price recovery) and risk (policy unpredictability).

6. **Permitting as Alpha:** The Trump administration's NEPA overhaul (14-day EA reviews, 28-day EIS) could dramatically accelerate US project timelines, benefiting LAC, MP, UUUU, and domestic developers.
