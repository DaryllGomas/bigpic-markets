# China & the Geopolitics of Critical Minerals

## Executive Summary

China has spent three decades building the most comprehensive critical minerals supply chain in history, controlling not just extraction but the far more strategically valuable processing and refining stages. This dominance now functions as an explicit geopolitical weapon. Beginning with gallium and germanium export controls in July 2023, Beijing has systematically demonstrated its willingness to weaponize mineral dependencies, escalating through antimony, graphite, rare earths, tungsten, and an expanding list of strategic materials. The result is a global scramble to build alternative supply chains — a process that will take 5-10 years at minimum and cost hundreds of billions of dollars. For investors, this creates a generational opportunity in Western mining and processing companies, while simultaneously exposing severe risks in any business dependent on Chinese mineral inputs.

## China Export Controls: The Weaponization of Mineral Dominance

### The Opening Salvo: Gallium and Germanium (July 2023)

China fired the first shot in the modern mineral trade war on July 3, 2023, when the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced export licensing requirements for gallium and germanium products. The timing was deliberate — a direct response to U.S. semiconductor export controls imposed in October 2022 and Dutch ASML restrictions that followed.

The impact was immediate and severe. China produces 98% of the world's low-purity gallium and approximately 68% of germanium, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Between July and September 2023, exports of gallium fell from nearly 6,900 kilograms to effectively zero, while germanium shipments dropped from about 8,000 kilograms to just 1 kilogram. This removed approximately 90% of global gallium supply and 60% of germanium supply from international markets overnight.

By May 2025, the Rotterdam price of gallium had reached $687 per kilogram — an increase of over 150% from pre-control levels. The U.S. International Trade Commission estimated that a complete halt of Chinese gallium and germanium exports could reduce U.S. GDP by $3.1 to $3.4 billion, primarily through supply unavailability rather than price increases alone.

On December 3, 2024, China escalated further, outright banning shipments of gallium and germanium to the United States, with stringent penalties for violations. This transformed a licensing regime — theoretically navigable by compliant buyers — into a hard embargo targeting America specifically.

### Antimony: Targeting the Defense Industrial Base (August 2024)

China's August 14, 2024 announcement of antimony export controls, effective September 15, 2024, was specifically calibrated to strike at Western defense capabilities. Antimony is irreplaceable in armor-piercing ammunition, night-vision goggles, infrared sensors, precision optics, and flame retardants used in military applications.

The market impact was among the most dramatic in modern commodity history. Antimony prices surged from approximately $12,000 per metric ton before the announcement to $38,000 per metric ton by late September 2024 — a roughly 200% increase within weeks. China accounts for 48% of global antimony production and 63% of U.S. antimony imports. The United States has zero domestic antimony production and severely limited strategic stockpiles.

By December 2024, antimony shipments from China had dropped 97%. The Department of Defense scrambled to identify alternative sources, but the reality is stark: there is no quick substitute. Perpetua Resources' Stibnite Gold project in Idaho — the only significant U.S. antimony deposit — is years from production.

### Graphite Export Licensing (October 2023, Tightened 2024-2025)

China implemented graphite export licensing requirements in October 2023, targeting both natural and synthetic graphite — the dominant anode material in lithium-ion batteries. China controls approximately 65% of natural graphite production and over 90% of graphite processing into battery-grade material. The controls created particular anxiety in the EV industry, where graphite constitutes the single largest material component by weight in most battery designs.

The graphite controls were initially less disruptive than gallium or antimony restrictions, as China allowed export licenses to flow more freely. But the message was clear: Beijing can throttle the global battery supply chain at will.

### Rare Earth Processing Technology Export Bans (April & October 2025)

The most sweeping escalation came in 2025. On April 4, 2025, China introduced export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements — samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium — along with all related compounds, metals, and magnets. As export volumes fell sharply in April and May, carmakers in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere struggled to obtain permanent magnets, with some forced to cut utilization rates or temporarily shut down factories.

On October 9, 2025, MOFCOM announced even more stringent measures — the most extensive tightening of China's rare earth regulatory framework to date. The new controls required foreign companies to obtain a license from China to export "parts, components, and assemblies" containing Chinese-sourced rare earth materials or produced using Chinese rare earth technologies. New controls were also announced on equipment for processing rare earths, including milling, separation, and refining equipment. The list of controlled elements expanded to include holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium.

Most alarmingly, from December 1, 2025, the controls were set to apply extraterritorially to internationally-made products containing Chinese-sourced materials or manufactured using Chinese technologies — even if traded domestically within a third country. China's share in the production of sintered permanent magnets stands at approximately 94%, making this an existential threat to global motor, EV, wind turbine, and defense manufacturing.

### Tungsten, Tellurium, Bismuth, Indium, Molybdenum (February 2025)

On February 4, 2025, China announced export controls on five additional critical minerals: tungsten (essential for cutting tools, armor-piercing munitions), tellurium (solar cells, thermoelectric devices), bismuth (pharmaceuticals, lead replacement), indium (displays, semiconductors), and molybdenum (steel alloys, catalysts). China produces approximately 83% of the world's tungsten and dominates processing for the others.

### The November 2025 Pause — Strategic Breathing Room, Not Retreat

On November 7, 2025, following the U.S.-China trade agreement reached on October 30, MOFCOM announced a temporary suspension of the October 9 export control escalation, effective until November 10, 2026. China issued general licenses valid for exports of rare earths, gallium, germanium, antimony, and graphite for U.S. end users and their suppliers globally.

However, this was explicitly framed as a "temporary adjustment" — not a permanent reversal. Critical controls remain in effect:

- The February 2025 controls on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium were **not** suspended
- The April 2025 addition of seven heavy rare earth elements to the controlled list remains permanent
- The underlying Dual-Use Items Control List expansions continue uninterrupted
- China retained the legal and bureaucratic infrastructure to reimpose all controls within days

Companies now have approximately one year to prepare for the possibility of restrictions returning in November 2026 — or facing different, potentially more severe restrictions.

### Potential Escalation Scenarios: What Could Be Next

**Tier 1 — High Probability (2026-2027):**
- Reimposition of all suspended controls if U.S.-China relations deteriorate
- Export controls on phosphoric acid (China produces 75% of purified battery-grade supply)
- Controls on high-purity manganese sulfate (China produces 95%)
- Tightening of magnet component export requirements

**Tier 2 — Medium Probability:**
- Controls on fluorite and fluorspar (China produces ~60%)
- Restrictions on vanadium (China produces ~55%)
- Technology transfer restrictions on battery manufacturing equipment
- Controls on synthetic graphite manufacturing technology

**Tier 3 — Escalation Scenarios:**
- Complete rare earth embargo targeting specific countries
- Controls on refined copper products
- Restrictions on silicon metal (China produces ~70%)
- Secondary sanctions on third countries re-exporting Chinese minerals

## Belt and Road Mineral Access: China's Global Resource Empire

### DRC Cobalt: The Crown Jewel

The Democratic Republic of Congo accounts for approximately 76% of global cobalt mine production and stands as China's most strategically important mineral investment zone. Almost all of the DRC's cobalt production flows through Chinese-controlled supply chains.

**China Molybdenum (CMOC)** is the world's largest cobalt producer, with 2024 production reaching approximately 114,200 tonnes. CMOC operates through two major DRC subsidiaries:

- **Tenke Fungurume Mining (TFM):** Acquired from Freeport-McMoRan in 2016 for $2.65 billion, TFM is one of the world's largest copper-cobalt mines. CMOC's 2025 export quota allocation included 2,250 tonnes for TFM.
- **Kisanfu Mining (KM):** CMOC's newer DRC operation received a 4,250-tonne export quota for 2025. CMOC's combined DRC operations produced 61,073 tonnes in the first half of 2025 alone, even during a national export suspension.

**CATL**, the world's largest battery manufacturer, holds a significant shareholding position in CMOC, creating a vertically integrated supply chain from Congolese mines to Chinese battery factories to global EV manufacturing. This integration gives China end-to-end control over the cobalt value chain.

**Glencore's Mutanda Mine**, while Swiss-headquartered, received only 1,150 tonnes of export quota in 2025 — a fraction of CMOC's allocation, illustrating how even Western-owned assets in the DRC increasingly operate within Chinese-dominated frameworks.

The DRC imposed a cobalt export ban in February 2025 amid a price collapse driven by oversupply (ironically, largely from Chinese-backed operations). The subsequent quota system allocated the largest share to CMOC, further entrenching Chinese control.

### Indonesian Nickel: The Belt and Road Template

China's investment in Indonesia's nickel sector has become the model for how Beijing converts raw materials access into industrial dominance. An estimated $30 billion in Chinese investment flowed into Indonesia's nickel industry between 2018 and 2025.

**The Morowali Industrial Park** — China's flagship Belt and Road mineral processing project — was established through Tsingshan Group's 2009 joint venture with Indonesia's Bintang Delapan Group, then scaled dramatically after Indonesia's 2014 nickel ore export ban. The park now hosts 48 nickel processing facilities accounting for 30% of Indonesia's production capacity.

The critical innovation was deploying **High Pressure Acid Leach (HPAL) technology** at scale. In May 2021, Indonesia's first HPAL plant was commissioned — achieving with Chinese backing what Western companies had failed to commercialize for decades. HPAL enables production of battery-grade nickel from laterite ores, turning Indonesia's vast low-grade deposits into EV supply chain feedstock.

CNGR Advanced Materials is building a nickel matte plant with 80,000 tonnes per year capacity, expected to begin operations in 2025. The environmental costs have been severe — a devastating tailings area landslide in March 2025 killed two workers, and environmental groups have documented widespread pollution of rivers, forests, and coastal waters across Sulawesi.

This model — take Chinese capital and technology, process raw materials in-country, then ship intermediates to Chinese factories — is being replicated globally.

### Lithium: Ganfeng and Tianqi's Global Stranglehold

Chinese lithium giants Ganfeng Lithium and Tianqi Lithium collectively controlled access to nearly 40% of global lithium production as of 2023, and have expanded since.

**Ganfeng Lithium's global portfolio:**

- **Argentina:** $962 million invested in Pozuelos and Pastos Grandes projects. In August 2025, Ganfeng executed a 67/33 joint venture with Lithium Argentina consolidating $1.8 billion in existing investments, targeting 150,000 MT/year of lithium carbonate equivalent through DLE and solar evaporation
- **Mali (Goulamina mine):** Entered production December 2024 with 506,000 MT spodumene capacity, with plans to double to 1 million MT/year. Ganfeng holds 65% after buying out Leo Lithium
- **Brazil (Salinas project):** Acquired via Latin Resources acquisition for AU$560 million, approved January 2025. Resource estimate: 77.7 million MT at 1.24% lithium oxide
- **Australia (Mount Marion):** 50/50 joint venture with MinRes, producing 600,000 MT/year spodumene concentrate since 2017

**Tianqi Lithium's strategic positions:**

- **Australia (Greenbushes mine):** 51% stake through joint venture with IGO, plus wholly-owned Kwinana lithium hydroxide plant — the world's largest hard-rock lithium operation
- **Chile (SQM stake):** $4.1 billion investment giving Tianqi strategic influence over the Salar de Atacama, the world's highest-grade lithium brine deposit. Environmental concerns include declining water tables and agricultural impacts

### Guinea Bauxite

Guinea exported nearly 100 million tonnes of bauxite in the first half of 2025 alone, commanding over 50% of global bauxite exports. China purchased approximately 70% of Guinea's output, primarily through the SMB-Winning Consortium — a Chinese-Singaporean joint venture. Following Guinea's 2023 export halt, Chinese firms including Chalco and SMB-Winning agreed to build three local alumina refineries over five years, deepening integration.

### Zimbabwe Lithium

Chinese mining and battery companies have invested over $4.5 billion in Zimbabwe's lithium mines. Over $1 billion flooded in within two years after Zimbabwe's 2022 raw lithium export ban, as Chinese firms positioned to build local processing facilities — a pattern of converting resource nationalism into deeper Chinese integration.

### Myanmar Rare Earths

China's most sensitive mineral dependency may be Myanmar's heavy rare earth deposits. Several mining operations operate outside formal regulatory frameworks, estimated to represent approximately half of global heavy rare earth production and 15-20% of all rare earth elements. This concentration means China itself depends on a single, politically unstable source for the heavy rare earths essential to its own magnet industry — a vulnerability Beijing is acutely aware of.

### Environmental and Human Rights Concerns

Chinese-backed mineral projects face escalating scrutiny:

- **DRC cobalt:** Documented child labor in artisanal mining, toxic dust exposure, community displacement
- **Indonesia nickel:** Deforestation, river contamination, tailings failures, worker deaths (including the March 2025 landslide)
- **Myanmar rare earths:** Unregulated mining causing soil erosion, toxic runoff, deforestation in Kachin State
- **Guinea bauxite:** Destruction of farmland, water contamination, displacement of communities
- **Chile lithium:** Water table depletion in the Atacama Desert threatening indigenous communities

These concerns are increasingly weaponized in Western policy debates to justify restrictions on Chinese-sourced materials, creating both regulatory risk for Chinese investments and market opportunity for ESG-compliant Western alternatives.

## U.S.-China Decoupling: Timeline of Escalating Mineral Tensions

### Phase 1: Opening Moves (2018-2022)

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| March 2018 | U.S. imposes steel/aluminum tariffs under Section 232 | Opens trade conflict; China retaliates on agricultural goods |
| May 2019 | China threatens to cut rare earth supply | Markets panic; NdFeB magnet prices spike 15% |
| June 2019 | Xi Jinping visits Jiangxi rare earth hub | Symbolic signal interpreted as escalation threat |
| October 2022 | U.S. restricts semiconductor equipment exports to China | Triggers China's decision to weaponize minerals |
| December 2022 | USGS publishes updated Critical Minerals List | Adds gallium and germanium for first time |

### Phase 2: Active Weaponization (2023-2024)

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| July 2023 | China imposes gallium/germanium export controls | Gallium exports drop to zero; prices surge 150%+ |
| October 2023 | China adds graphite export licensing | Battery supply chains disrupted |

| December 2024 | China bans gallium/germanium/antimony exports to U.S. | Hard embargo replaces licensing regime |

### Phase 3: Full Escalation and Pause (2025-2026)

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| February 2025 | Controls on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium, molybdenum | Five additional minerals restricted |
| April 2025 | Seven heavy rare earths + magnets controlled | Auto/defense sectors face shutdowns |

| November 2025 | Suspension of October controls until Nov 2026 | Temporary pause; structural controls remain |
| January 2026 | Trump signs critical minerals executive order | Emphasizes international partnerships |

### Chinese Retaliation Patterns and Escalation Ladder

China's mineral export control strategy follows a consistent escalation pattern:

1. **Licensing Requirements:** Initial step — creates bureaucratic friction and uncertainty without outright bans. Allows selective enforcement against specific countries or companies
2. **Tightened Licensing:** Reduces approved licenses, creating de facto supply reduction while maintaining deniability
3. **Country-Specific Bans:** Direct embargoes targeting the United States specifically, as implemented in December 2024
4. **Technology Controls:** Restricting processing know-how and equipment, not just raw materials — the October 2025 innovation
5. **Extraterritorial Application:** Extending controls to products containing Chinese materials even when traded between third countries — the most aggressive escalation tool

Each escalation has been carefully calibrated as a response to specific U.S. actions, primarily semiconductor export controls and tariff increases. This tit-for-tat pattern means the trajectory is largely predictable: further U.S. tech restrictions will trigger further Chinese mineral restrictions.

### Impact on Downstream Industries

**Electric Vehicles:** The most directly affected sector. Rare earth magnet shortages forced some automakers to cut production in Q2 2025. Battery-grade graphite, cobalt, and lithium supply chains all face Chinese chokepoint risk. The combined effect is estimated to add $2,000-$5,000 per vehicle in supply chain risk premiums.

**Defense:** Antimony shortages directly impact ammunition and night-vision equipment production. Rare earth magnet restrictions threaten precision-guided munitions, jet engine components, and submarine propulsion systems. The DoD has identified 14 critical mineral dependencies with single-source Chinese supply risk.

**Technology:** Gallium is essential for 5G infrastructure, radar systems, and LED manufacturing. Germanium is critical for fiber optics and infrared optics. Both face near-total Chinese supply dependency.

### Corporate Supply Chain Diversification Strategies

Leading companies are pursuing several approaches:

- **Direct mine investments:** Tesla's lithium rights in Nevada, Apple's cobalt sourcing agreements with Congo miners
- **Long-term offtake agreements:** GM's partnerships with MP Materials, Livent; Ford's deal with Ioneer
- **Vertical integration:** BYD's acquisition of lithium mines in Africa; CATL's upstream expansion
- **Material substitution:** Shift from NdFeB magnets to ferrite in some motor designs; LFP batteries reducing cobalt/nickel dependency
- **Recycling infrastructure:** Redwood Materials, Li-Cycle building urban mining capacity

### Friendshoring and Nearshoring Trends

The Biden administration's approach centered on "friendshoring" — building supply chains through allied nations. Trump's January 2026 executive order shifted emphasis to domestic production, even at the expense of allied supply chains. The tension between these approaches remains unresolved.

Key friendshoring partnerships:
- **U.S.-Australia:** Critical minerals framework agreement; Lynas processing facility in Texas
- **U.S.-Canada:** Joint critical minerals action plan; Canada's C$3.8 billion critical minerals strategy
- **U.S.-Japan:** Supply chain resilience initiative; joint rare earth recycling projects
- **Minerals Security Partnership (MSP):** 14-country coalition coordinating mineral supply chain investment

The fundamental challenge remains: friendshoring requires willing partners with actual mineral deposits and processing capabilities. Many potential partners (Australia, Canada, Chile) face their own permitting, environmental, and capacity constraints. Goldman Sachs Research estimates that of 20 planned rare earth projects worldwide, only two or three will likely become operational by 2030.

## IRA Critical Mineral Requirements

### Section 30D EV Tax Credit Structure

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 restructured the $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit into two equal components:

- **Critical Mineral Requirement ($3,750):** A specified percentage of the value of critical minerals in the battery must be extracted or processed in the United States or a country with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement (FTA), or recycled in North America
- **Battery Component Requirement ($3,750):** A specified percentage of battery components must be manufactured or assembled in North America

### Critical Mineral Percentage Thresholds

| Year | Critical Mineral % | Battery Component % |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 2023 | 40% | 50% |
| 2024 | 50% | 60% |
| 2025 | 60% | 60% |
| 2026 | 70% | 70% |
| 2027 | 80% | 80% |
| 2028 | 80% | 90% |
| 2029+ | 80% | 100% |

The escalating thresholds create an annual tightening that progressively squeezes out Chinese mineral inputs from qualifying vehicles.

### Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules

The FEOC provisions are the most consequential aspect of the IRA for critical minerals geopolitics:

- **Effective 2024:** Eligible vehicles cannot contain battery components manufactured or assembled by a FEOC
- **Effective 2025:** Eligible vehicles cannot contain applicable critical minerals extracted, processed, or recycled by a FEOC

A business is classified as a FEOC if:
- It is incorporated in, headquartered in, or performing relevant activities in a "covered nation" (China, Russia, North Korea, Iran)
- 25% or more of board seats, voting rights, or equity interest are cumulatively held by a covered nation's government, government officials, or entities

**Phase-in complexity:** The 25% ownership threshold creates intricate compliance challenges. Many mineral supply chains involve entities with partial Chinese ownership, joint ventures with Chinese partners, or processing through Chinese-owned facilities in third countries. Tracing mineral provenance through multi-stage supply chains is technically difficult and costly.

### Which Vehicles Qualify

As thresholds increase, fewer vehicles qualify for the full $7,500 credit. In 2025, most affordable EVs either qualify for partial credits ($3,750) or no credit at all due to battery component or mineral sourcing failures. Tesla, GM, and Ford vehicles assembled in North America with LFP batteries (which avoid cobalt and nickel sourcing issues) have fared better than competitors relying on NMC chemistries with deeper Chinese supply chain exposure.

### Workarounds: Free Trade Agreement Mineral Sourcing

The FTA provision creates strategic loopholes. Minerals processed in countries with U.S. free trade agreements (Australia, Canada, Chile, South Korea, Japan, and others) qualify even if originally mined elsewhere. This has driven investment in processing facilities in FTA countries — effectively friendshoring by financial incentive rather than government mandate.

The U.S.-Japan critical minerals agreement (March 2023) and similar arrangements with the EU are specifically designed to expand the universe of qualifying mineral sources.

### Impact on EV Pricing and Adoption

The critical mineral requirements are creating a bifurcated market:
- Vehicles qualifying for full credits become relatively more affordable, driving consumer preference toward qualifying models
- Vehicles failing to qualify face a $3,750-$7,500 price disadvantage, potentially pricing them out of the mass market
- Chinese-brand EVs (BYD, NIO, etc.) are effectively excluded from the U.S. market through both tariffs (100% on Chinese EVs) and FEOC disqualification

The net effect accelerates de-Sinicization of the North American EV supply chain while raising near-term costs for manufacturers scrambling to qualify.

## EU Critical Raw Materials Act

### Key Benchmarks (2030 Targets)

The EU Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), entered into force in May 2024, sets four binding benchmarks for strategic raw materials by 2030:

| Benchmark | Target | Current Level (est.) |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| EU extraction | 10% of annual consumption | ~3% |
| EU processing | 40% of annual consumption | ~15% |
| EU recycling | 25% of annual consumption | ~10% |
| Single-country dependency | Max 65% from any one source | Many minerals exceed 65% from China |

### Strategic Projects Designation

The Commission designated 47 Strategic Projects in the first selection round (March 2025), with 13 additional projects in third countries and overseas territories. A second call for strategic projects closed in January 2026.

Selected projects receive:
- Accelerated permitting: 27 months for extraction permits, 15 months for processing and recycling permits
- Priority access to EU financing mechanisms
- Streamlined environmental impact assessments

The 47 strategic projects require approximately EUR 22.5 billion in capital investment — a fraction of what is needed to achieve the 2030 benchmarks.

### EU Mineral Partnerships

The EU has signed 14 Strategic Partnerships on raw materials, creating a diplomatic network to diversify supply:

| Partner | Year Signed | Focus Minerals |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Canada | 2021 | Nickel, cobalt, lithium |
| Ukraine | 2021 | Titanium, lithium, rare earths |
| Kazakhstan | 2022 | Chromium, manganese, rare earths |
| Namibia | 2022 | Lithium, rare earths, cobalt |
| Argentina | 2023 | Lithium |
| Chile | 2023 | Lithium, copper |
| Zambia | 2023 | Cobalt, copper |
| DRC | 2023 | Cobalt, tantalum |
| Greenland | 2023 | Rare earths |
| Norway | 2024 | Rare earths, nickel |
| Rwanda | 2024 | Tantalum, tin |
| Serbia | 2024 | Lithium (Jadar project) |
| Uzbekistan | 2024 | Uranium, tungsten |
| Australia | 2024 | Lithium, rare earths, cobalt |

The RESourceEU initiative, announced in October 2025, will deepen partnerships with Australia, Canada, Chile, Greenland, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. A new CRM Facility will directly support partnerships between European industry and mining projects in partner countries.

### Comparison with U.S. Approach

| Dimension | EU (CRMA) | U.S. (IRA + Executive Orders) |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Primary mechanism | Regulatory benchmarks + permitting reform | Tax incentives + FEOC restrictions |
| Domestic production emphasis | Moderate (10% extraction target) | High (Trump EO: domestic focus) |
| Partnership approach | Broad diplomatic network (14 partners) | Selective (MSP + bilateral FTAs) |
| FEOC equivalent | None explicit; 65% dependency cap is softer | Hard FEOC exclusion from tax credits |
| Recycling emphasis | Strong (25% target) | Moderate (qualifies for IRA credit) |
| Permitting reform | Specific timelines (27/15 months) | Streamlining via executive action |
| Investment scale | ~EUR 22.5B (strategic projects) | $400M+ DoD investment in MP Materials alone |
| Timeline pressure | 2030 benchmarks | Annual IRA threshold increases |

The EU approach is broader but softer — creating targets and partnerships without the hard exclusionary mechanisms of the IRA's FEOC rules. The U.S. approach is more aggressive on decoupling but more narrowly focused on EV supply chains.

## Supply Chain Mapping and Vulnerability Assessment

### Most Vulnerable Minerals: Risk Matrix

| Mineral | China Production Share | China Processing Share | Import Reliance (U.S.) | Substitutability | Overall Risk |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Gallium | 98% | 98% | 100% | Very Low | **CRITICAL** |
| Heavy Rare Earths (Dy, Tb) | 90%+ (incl. Myanmar) | 92% | 100% | Very Low | **CRITICAL** |
| Germanium | 68% | 68% | >50% | Low | **CRITICAL** |
| Antimony | 48% | 55% | >60% | Very Low (defense) | **CRITICAL** |
| Natural Graphite (battery) | 65% | >90% | >50% | Medium | **HIGH** |
| Magnesium | 95% | 95% | >50% | Low | **HIGH** |
| Tungsten | 83% | 83% | >50% | Low | **HIGH** |
| Manganese (HP sulfate) | 35% | 95% | >90% | Low | **HIGH** |
| Cobalt (refined) | 2% (mined) | 73% (refined) | >70% | Medium | **HIGH** |
| Lithium (refined) | 15% (mined) | 59% (refined) | >60% | Medium | **MODERATE** |
| Nickel (refined) | 5% (mined) | 68% (refined) | >30% | Medium | **MODERATE** |
| Phosphoric acid (battery grade) | <10% (mined) | 75% (battery grade) | >60% | Low | **HIGH** |

### Single Points of Failure

The critical vulnerability in the minerals supply chain is not mining — it is the intermediate processing and refining stage where China's dominance is most extreme and hardest to replicate:

1. **Rare earth separation:** China controls 92% of global capacity. Only five ex-China refineries exist (Nevada, Malaysia, France, Estonia, Western Australia). Building a new separation plant takes 5-7 years and $500M+.

2. **Permanent magnet manufacturing:** China produces 94% of sintered NdFeB magnets. The technology requires both separated rare earth inputs AND specialized manufacturing know-how. No significant Western magnet production exists outside of Japan.

3. **Battery-grade graphite spheronization:** China controls >90% of graphite processing into anode material. The process requires specialized purification (to 99.95%+) that few facilities outside China can achieve at scale.

4. **Gallium refining:** With 98% production share and no significant ex-China capacity, gallium represents the most extreme single point of failure in the entire critical minerals supply chain.

5. **Cobalt refining:** While the DRC dominates mining, China controls 73% of refining. Cobalt mined in the DRC is shipped to China for processing before entering global supply chains.

### Chokepoint Analysis: Processing, Refining, Manufacturing

The supply chain has three chokepoint layers:

**Layer 1 — Mining:** Relatively diversified. Australia, Chile, DRC, Indonesia, and others provide geographic distribution. The exception is heavy rare earths (China + Myanmar = ~90%).

**Layer 2 — Processing/Refining:** Maximum concentration. China refines 73% of cobalt, 68% of nickel, 59% of lithium, 92% of rare earths, 95% of manganese sulfate, 75% of battery-grade phosphoric acid. This layer is the true chokepoint.

**Layer 3 — Component Manufacturing:** Slightly less concentrated but still dominated. China produces 78% of cathode materials, 91% of anode materials, 82% of battery cells, 94% of rare earth magnets. Japanese and Korean manufacturers provide partial diversification at the cell level.

### Scenario Analysis: Supply Disruption Impacts

**Scenario 1: China cuts off heavy rare earth supply**
- Impact: Global EV production drops 30-40% within 3 months as permanent magnet motors lose supply
- Wind turbine manufacturing halts for offshore direct-drive designs
- Military precision-guided munitions production severely constrained
- Timeline to alternative supply: 5-7 years for separation capacity, 7-10 years for full supply chain
- Lynas (Australia), MP Materials (U.S.) can partially offset light rare earths but not heavy

**Scenario 2: China cuts off gallium supply**
- Impact: 5G infrastructure deployment slows globally; military radar production constrained
- GaN semiconductor production drops 50%+ within 6 months
- Timeline to alternative supply: 3-5 years; potential recovery from aluminum smelter byproduct streams in Canada, Germany, Japan
- Estimated GDP impact: $3.1-3.4 billion for U.S. alone

**Scenario 3: China restricts all battery material processing**
- Impact: Global EV production drops 60%+ within 6 months
- Battery cell costs increase 40-80% as alternative processing scrambles to scale
- Energy storage deployment for grid applications severely constrained
- Timeline to alternative supply: 3-5 years for lithium/nickel; 5-8 years for graphite anode; 7-10 years for full independence

**Scenario 4: Coordinated restriction across all critical minerals**
- Impact: Cascading industrial disruption across defense, automotive, energy, technology sectors
- Estimated global GDP impact: $200-500 billion over 5 years (Atlantic Council estimate)
- Military readiness directly compromised within 12-18 months
- Full alternative supply chain: 10-15 years, $500B+ investment required

### Estimated Timeline to Build Alternative Supply Chains

| Mineral/Process | Current Non-China Capacity | Projected Capacity (2030) | Full Independence Feasible? |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Rare earth mining | ~30% (ex-China) | ~40% | Mining: Yes |
| Rare earth separation | ~8% | ~15-20% | Separation: 2032+ |
| NdFeB magnet production | ~6% | ~12-15% | Magnets: 2035+ |

## Sanctions Risk and Investment Implications

### Companies with Significant China Exposure

**High Risk — Direct Chinese Supply Dependency:**
- Companies sourcing >50% of key inputs from Chinese processors
- Automakers relying on Chinese NdFeB magnets for traction motors (most global OEMs)
- Battery cell manufacturers sourcing cathode/anode from Chinese suppliers
- Wind turbine manufacturers dependent on Chinese permanent magnets

**Moderate Risk — Indirect Exposure:**
- Companies with Chinese joint venture partners in mineral supply chains
- Manufacturers using components containing Chinese-origin materials
- Companies with significant China revenue at risk of retaliatory measures

**FEOC Risk:**
- Any company with 25%+ Chinese government-linked ownership
- Joint ventures structured with Chinese state-owned enterprises
- Companies processing minerals in Chinese facilities, even if the company itself is non-Chinese

### Beneficiaries of Decoupling

**Tier 1 — Direct Beneficiaries:**

| Company | Ticker | Mineral Focus | Strategic Position |
|---------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| MP Materials | MP | Rare earths | Only U.S. rare earth mine (Mountain Pass); $400M DoD partnership; building magnet factory in Texas |

| Iluka Resources | ILU.AX | Rare earths | Eneabba refinery (Australia); government-backed |

### Risks of Investing in China-Dependent Companies

1. **Supply disruption risk:** The November 2025 suspension is explicitly temporary. Companies that fail to diversify face sudden supply cutoffs when/if controls resume
2. **FEOC compliance risk:** Companies with Chinese joint ventures or processing arrangements may lose IRA tax credit eligibility as thresholds tighten
3. **Regulatory risk:** Expanding FEOC definitions could retroactively disqualify previously compliant supply chains
4. **Reputational risk:** ESG-focused investors increasingly penalizing China-dependent supply chains
5. **Technology lock-in:** Companies using Chinese processing technology face extraterritorial control risk under October 2025 regulations (even if currently suspended)

### Geopolitical Risk Premium in Mineral Pricing

The gallium, germanium, and antimony price spikes of 2023-2025 established a permanent geopolitical risk premium in critical mineral pricing. Key dynamics:

- **Baseline premium:** Markets now price in 10-20% geopolitical risk for all Chinese-dominated minerals, even during the suspension period
- **Spike risk:** Any diplomatic deterioration (Taiwan tension, tech war escalation) can trigger 100-200%+ price spikes within days
- **Inventory behavior:** Western buyers are building strategic stockpiles, creating sustained demand above consumption levels
- **Contract structure shift:** Long-term offtake agreements with non-Chinese suppliers command premium pricing as supply security becomes more valuable than marginal cost savings

### Three Scenarios for Investors

**Scenario A — Continued Escalation (35% probability):**
The November 2026 expiry of the U.S.-China trade agreement passes without renewal. China reimplements all October 2025 controls plus additional restrictions. Western mineral companies surge; China-dependent manufacturers face severe disruption.

*Investment implications:* Overweight MP Materials, Lynas, Perpetua, Albemarle, battery recyclers. Underweight any manufacturer without diversified mineral supply.

**Scenario B — Status Quo / Managed Tension (45% probability):**
The agreement is extended with modifications. Some controls remain, some are eased. Gradual Western supply chain buildout continues. Chinese companies maintain dominant market share but face increasing competition.

*Investment implications:* Selective exposure to Western miners with strong project pipelines. Maintain diversified positions. Battery recycling becomes increasingly strategic.

**Scenario C — Detente (20% probability):**
Broader U.S.-China trade normalization leads to long-term mineral trade stability. Chinese export controls are permanently relaxed. Western supply chain investment slows as urgency diminishes.

*Investment implications:* Near-term correction in Western mining equities as supply urgency diminishes. Long-term fundamentals remain strong due to growing demand from energy transition.

## Key Geopolitical Risk Indicators to Monitor

1. **Taiwan Strait tensions:** Any military escalation would trigger immediate mineral supply disruption
2. **U.S. semiconductor export controls:** Further tightening virtually guarantees Chinese mineral retaliation
3. **November 2026 trade agreement expiry:** The single most important near-term catalyst
4. **Chinese rare earth magnet technology restrictions:** Extraterritorial enforcement signals escalation intent
5. **DRC political stability:** Coups, civil conflict, or resource nationalism could disrupt cobalt supply
6. **Indonesian nickel policy:** Any raw ore export ban expansion or Chinese investment restrictions
7. **U.S. DoD mineral stockpiling:** Accelerated purchases signal government anticipation of disruption
8. **FEOC rule expansions:** Treasury Department rulemaking on ownership thresholds and mineral tracing
