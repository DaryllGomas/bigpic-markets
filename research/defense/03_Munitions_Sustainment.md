# Munitions Industrial Base & Defense Sustainment

## Executive Summary

The U.S. munitions industrial base is undergoing its most dramatic expansion since the Cold War, driven by Ukraine replenishment demands, rising great-power competition, and the realization that decades of peacetime procurement left dangerously thin inventories. The FY2026 NDAA authorized more than $28.8 billion in multi-year munitions procurement contracts — a historic signal to industry that demand is structural, not cyclical. Across every category — from 155mm artillery shells to hypersonic glide vehicles to directed-energy systems — production rates are ramping 2-4x from pre-2022 baselines. Yet bottlenecks in propellant manufacturing, explosive fill capacity, seeker components, and workforce availability continue to constrain the pace of the buildup. Meanwhile, the $80B+ annual defense sustainment market is growing as legacy platforms age and the F-35 fleet expands toward its $1.7 trillion lifetime sustainment burden. Investors face a generational opportunity in the munitions-sustainment complex, but must navigate execution risk around production ramp timelines, supply chain fragility, and political uncertainty around Ukraine-related spending.

## 1. Ammunition Industrial Base

### 1.1 155mm Artillery Shell Production

The 155mm artillery round has become the defining munition of the Ukraine conflict and the bellwether for U.S. industrial base health. Before Russia's 2022 invasion, the Army produced approximately 14,000 rounds per month. The goal: reach 100,000 rounds per month — a 7x increase.

**Current Status (Late 2025):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Pre-Ukraine baseline | ~14,000 rounds/month |
| Current production rate | ~40,000 rounds/month |
| Near-term target | 100,000 rounds/month |
| Target date (revised) | Mid-2026 |
| Army investment | $635M+ in new facilities |

The Army has taken a multi-pronged approach to scaling production:

- **New Camden Facility (Arkansas):** General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS) opened a new 155mm production facility at the Calhoun County site in April 2025, designed to produce 50,000 completed projectiles per month at full capacity. The $635M investment includes advanced automation, digital quality tracking, and environmentally conscious manufacturing processes.

- **Universal Artillery Project Lines (UAPL):** The Mesquite, Texas facility — also under GD-OTS — has faced significant delays. GD-OTS missed period-of-performance completion dates for UAPL lines 1 and 2, and failed six consecutive First Article Test dates spanning April 2024 through June 2025. The Army issued a formal "show cause" letter warning it would consider terminating GD's contract oversight of the new production lines.

- **Supply Chain Diversification:** The Army launched an initiative to eliminate single-source dependencies for 155mm shell components. By end of 2025, the goal was to have at least two qualified suppliers for every critical material and subcomponent — including metal forgings, fuzes, and propellant charges.

**Key Takeaway:** Despite massive investment, the 100K/month goal has slipped from late 2025 to mid-2026. GD-OTS execution risk on UAPL is a concern, though the Camden facility is performing well. The production ramp is real but slower than hoped, reflecting decades of deferred investment in the organic industrial base.

### 1.2 General Dynamics Ordnance & Tactical Systems (GD-OTS)

GD-OTS (a division of General Dynamics, ticker: GD) is the primary integrator for large-caliber ammunition production, including 155mm projectiles, mortar systems, and bomb bodies. GD-OTS operates or manages several government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities including:

- Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (Pennsylvania) — metal parts manufacturing
- Camden operations (Arkansas) — new 155mm production
- Mesquite, Texas — UAPL facility (troubled)

Despite the UAPL setbacks, GD-OTS remains the dominant player in large-caliber ammunition by virtue of its scale, government relationships, and institutional knowledge. The company's overall defense revenue trajectory benefits from the ammunition surge even as individual contract performance faces scrutiny.

### 1.3 Northrop Grumman Ammunition (NOC)

Northrop Grumman's ammunition portfolio (inherited partly from Orbital ATK, acquired in 2018) spans medium-caliber, tank ammunition, and propulsion systems:

- **Tank Ammunition:** Northrop is the U.S. government's premier partner for 120mm tank ammunition for the M1 Abrams. The M829A4 armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) round deliveries were completed, and the company is now in full-rate production of the next-generation M1147 Advanced Multi-Purpose (AMP) round. Northrop is also developing a next-generation training round to replicate AMP ballistics.

- **Medium Caliber:** In December 2025, the Army awarded Northrop a contract valued over $200 million to produce the XM1211 High Explosive Proximity (HEP) fuzed medium-caliber round. Northrop has also expanded international co-production, signing an MOU with Lithuania in June 2025 to co-produce medium-caliber ammunition in partnership with Nammo Defense Systems — supporting NATO interoperability and allied capacity.

- **International Expansion:** Northrop finalized a deal to co-produce ammunition in Ukraine in 2024, with ambitions to expand into 155mm artillery shell and tank ammunition production on Ukrainian soil.

### 1.4 Olin Corporation / Winchester (OLN)

Olin Corporation's Winchester division is the largest producer of small-caliber ammunition for the U.S. military. Key developments:

- **Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (LCAAP):** Winchester operates this nearly 4,000-acre government-owned facility in Independence, Missouri — the primary source of 5.56mm, 7.62mm, and .50 caliber ammunition for the U.S. military. Annual production capacity exceeds 1.6 billion rounds.

- **NGSW 6.8mm Facility:** Winchester broke ground on a 450,000 sq. ft. advanced manufacturing facility at LCAAP in early 2025, designed to produce all components of the new 6.8x51mm ammunition for the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) program (XM7 rifle and XM250 automatic rifle). The facility is planned to open in 2026 and will ramp production steadily.

- **AMMO Inc. Acquisition:** In April 2025, Olin completed the acquisition of AMMO, Inc.'s small-caliber ammunition assets, including a 185,000 sq. ft. production facility in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. This acquisition consolidates small-caliber manufacturing capacity under the Winchester brand and positions Olin for commercial and military demand growth.

**Investment Thesis (OLN):** Olin trades at a significant discount to pure-play defense names despite having a near-monopoly on U.S. military small-caliber ammunition. The NGSW transition creates a multi-year demand cycle as the Army replaces billions of legacy 5.56mm rounds with 6.8mm. However, Olin's chemicals business introduces cyclicality unrelated to defense.

### 1.5 Orbital ATK Heritage (Now Northrop Grumman)

The 2018 Orbital ATK acquisition gave Northrop Grumman a dominant position in solid rocket motors and propellants — critical choke points in the munitions supply chain:

- **Rocket Motors:** Northrop produces the solid rocket motors for Stinger, AMRAAM, and various missile systems. It also manufactures the booster stages for strategic missiles.
- **Propellants and Energetics:** Northrop's propellant capabilities complement the government-owned Radford and Holston plants, providing both R&D and production capacity.
- **Launch Vehicle Propulsion:** Solid rocket motor expertise feeds into both military and commercial space launch (GEM-63 boosters for ULA's Vulcan and Atlas V).

### 1.6 Army Organic Industrial Base

The U.S. Army's organic industrial base consists of 17 government-owned ammunition plants (GOGOs and GOCOs) that form the backbone of munitions production:

| Facility | Location | Primary Function |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Radford AAP | Virginia | Propellants (sole U.S. source for single/double/triple-base) |
| Holston AAP | Tennessee | Explosives (RDX, HMX) |
| McAlester AAP | Oklahoma | Bomb and warhead loading/assembly |
| Lake City AAP | Missouri | Small caliber ammunition (Winchester-operated) |
| Scranton AAP | Pennsylvania | Metal parts manufacturing |
| Iowa AAP | Iowa | Large-caliber loading, assembly, packing |
| Milan AAP | Tennessee | Demolitions, pyrotechnics |
| Pine Bluff Arsenal | Arkansas | Chemical/biological defense, smoke munitions |

**Modernization Status:** Many facilities operate with infrastructure and processes dating back 50+ years. The Army's Ammunition Plant Modernization Plan targets multi-billion dollar investments:

- **Radford AAP:** The sole U.S. facility for single, double, and triple-base propellants. Basic infrastructure requires extensive modernization — a critical vulnerability since Radford is a single point of failure for the entire munitions supply chain.
- **Holston AAP:** Expansion underway to rebuild explosives production processes, including a new nitration facility, melt-cast facility for insensitive munitions, and kettle drying operations for increased RDX and HMX output.
- **McAlester AAP:** Provides critical munitions loading functions for bombs, warheads, and missile components.

### 1.7 Ammunition Production Bottlenecks

The surge in 155mm and other ammunition production has exposed several structural bottlenecks:

| Bottleneck | Issue | Mitigation |
|------------|-------|------------|
| **Propellant** | Radford AAP is sole U.S. source; aging infrastructure | Modernization funding, allied propellant sourcing |
| **Explosive Fill** | Holston AAP capacity limits RDX/HMX output | New nitration and melt-cast facilities under construction |
| **Metal Forging** | Shell body forging capacity concentrated in few suppliers | Army diversifying to 2+ qualified sources per component |
| **Fuze Components** | Electronic fuze supply chain fragility | Domestic sourcing initiatives |
| **Workforce** | Specialized ammunition workers retiring; recruitment difficult | New facility jobs (185 at Camden), training programs |
| **Testing/QA** | First Article Test failures (GD-OTS UAPL) | Army oversight, potential contract reassignment |

## 2. Missile Production Ramp

### 2.1 Javelin (LMT/RTX Joint Venture)

The FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile became iconic in Ukraine's defense. The Javelin Joint Venture (Lockheed Martin and RTX) is executing a major production ramp:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Pre-surge production rate | ~2,100/year |
| Current production rate | ~2,400/year |
| Target rate (late 2026) | 3,960/year |
| Maximum theoretical capacity | 6,480/year |
| Ukraine replacement contract | $1.3B (~4,000 missiles) |

Manufacturing upgrades span facilities in Troy (Alabama), Ocala (Florida), and Huntsville (Alabama). In May 2025, the JV introduced a newly designed continuity test station at Troy to replace outdated systems — a rate-limiting step in the production flow. The 65% production increase requires facility expansion, automated testing equipment, and workforce growth across all three sites.

### 2.2 GMLRS / HIMARS Rockets (LMT)

The M142 HIMARS launcher and its Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) ammunition have been among the most effective weapons in Ukraine. Lockheed Martin is executing a historic production ramp:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| HIMARS launcher production (2025) | 96/year (doubled from baseline) |
| GMLRS rocket production (2025) | 14,000/year capacity |
| GMLRS target rate (FY2028) | ~19,000/year |
| Total GMLRS delivered to date | 75,000+ rockets |
| Major GMLRS contract (Aug 2025) | $4.2B |
| Countries with HIMARS on order | 20+ |

International demand is surging — Poland plans to purchase over 100 HIMARS units, with Romania, Estonia, Australia, Latvia, Lithuania, Italy, and others signed or in discussions. The GMLRS Extended Range (GMLRS-ER) variant doubles the rocket's range from 70km to 150km, further expanding the addressable market.

### 2.3 LRASM (LMT)

The AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile is the Navy and Air Force's primary anti-ship cruise missile — critical for Indo-Pacific scenarios:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2025 procurement | 115 missiles |
| FY2026 budget request | 118 missiles |
| Major contract (Aug 2025) | $9.5B (combined JASSM/LRASM, Lots 22-26/9-12) |
| Manufacturing expansion | 225,000 sq. ft. "intelligent factory" in Troy, AL |
| Advanced variant | LRASM C-3 entering service 2026 |

LRASM production is bundled with the larger JASSM (Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile) program — the Air Force's FY2025 budget covered 450 JASSMs alongside 115 LRASMs. The combined $9.5B multi-lot contract provides the demand signal Lockheed needs to invest in factory automation and workforce expansion.

### 2.4 Patriot PAC-3 MSE (LMT / RTX)

Patriot air defense has become the most sought-after military system globally. Production of the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor — built by Lockheed Martin — is undergoing a historic expansion:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 deliveries | 620 missiles |
| Current annual capacity | ~650/year |
| Target capacity (by 2030) | 2,000/year (3x increase) |
| Boeing seeker facility | 40,000 sq. ft. expansion |
| Boeing seeker target | 3,000 units by 2030 |

The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin have cemented a framework deal to triple PAC-3 MSE production over seven years. A key bottleneck is the active radar seeker produced by Boeing — the 40,000 sq. ft. seeker facility expansion was announced at Dubai Air Show 2025 to address European demand. RTX builds the Patriot radar, command-and-control system, and launchers, while Lockheed builds the interceptor itself.

### 2.5 SM-6 (RTX)

The Standard Missile-6 is the Navy's multi-mission workhorse — performing anti-air warfare, ballistic missile defense, and anti-surface warfare from Aegis-equipped destroyers and cruisers:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current production | Ramping |
| Target annual production | 500+/year |
| Framework agreement | Part of RTX 5-deal package (Feb 2026) |
| Growth rate | 2-4x from pre-2022 baseline |

SM-6 is part of the landmark five-deal framework agreement between RTX's Raytheon and the Department of War announced in February 2026, alongside Tomahawk, AMRAAM, SM-3 IB, and SM-3 IIA.

### 2.6 Stinger (RTX) — Production Restart Challenges

The FIM-92 Stinger MANPAD had not been manufactured for 20 years before the Ukraine conflict forced a production restart:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Production gap | ~20 years |
| Restart order | 1,700 missiles (delivery by 2026) |
| Challenges | Obsolete components, retired workforce |
| Replacement program | NGSRI (contract award ~2026) |
| NGSRI competitors | RTX vs. Lockheed Martin |
| NGSRI planned buy | Up to 8,000 missiles |

RTX had to redesign electronic components in the seeker head because original parts were no longer commercially available. The company recruited retired engineers to train current employees in the legacy manufacturing process. Meanwhile, the Next-Generation Short-Range Interceptor (NGSRI) program is progressing — Lockheed Martin conducted its first test fire in January 2026, while RTX tested its seeker, motor, and warhead in February 2025. A full-rate production decision is expected by 2028.

### 2.7 AMRAAM (RTX)

The AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile is the Western world's standard air-to-air munition:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2024 production goal | ~1,200/year |
| 2025 production | Nearly doubled from 2024 |
| New target | 1,900+/year |
| Framework agreement | Part of RTX 5-deal package |

AMRAAM production nearly doubled in 2025, and the new 1,900/year target represents a 58% increase from the 2024 goal. The missile is also used as the interceptor for the NASAMS ground-based air defense system provided to Ukraine.

### 2.8 Tomahawk (RTX)

The Block V Tomahawk upgrade adds a multi-mission capability including maritime strike:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target annual production | 1,000+/year |
| Framework agreement | Part of RTX 5-deal package (Feb 2026) |
| Block V upgrades | Maritime strike seeker, enhanced navigation |
| Growth rate | 2-4x from baseline |

### 2.9 PrSM — Precision Strike Missile (LMT)

PrSM is the Army's replacement for the aging ATACMS tactical ballistic missile, offering double the range (up to 500km with future increments) in a package that fits two per HIMARS pod instead of one:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| First deliveries | December 2023 (26 missiles in 2024) |
| 2025 deliveries | 54 missiles |
| Total Increment 1 contract | 400 missiles |
| Major production contract | $4.94B |
| Full-rate target | 400/year by FQ4 FY2027-2028 |
| Increment 4 first flight | Planned 2026 (long-range variant) |

PrSM Increment 1 achieved Milestone C (production decision) in mid-2025. As ATACMS production closes out over the next ~24 months, Lockheed can transition the full production facility to PrSM, enabling further capacity increases. Future increments add anti-ship capability (Increment 2), enhanced seekers, and extended range.

### 2.10 Multi-Year Procurement Impact

The FY2026 NDAA authorized up to $28.8 billion in multi-year procurement (MYP) contracts for munitions — a watershed moment for the defense industrial base:

**Programs authorized for MYP:**
- Patriot PAC-3 MSE
- THAAD interceptors
- Tomahawk
- JASSM / LRASM
- SM-3 Block IB and IIA
- SM-6
- AMRAAM

**Industrial Base Impact:**
MYP contracts provide the stable demand signal that defense companies need to make large capital investments in new factories, automated production lines, and workforce development. The contracts also allow second- and third-tier suppliers to invest in capacity — addressing the supply chain depth problem that has constrained past production ramps. The Secretary of Defense must report semi-annually on the status of each MYP award, creating accountability for execution.

## 3. Hypersonic Weapons

### 3.1 Dark Eagle (LRHW) — U.S. Army

The Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), formally designated "Dark Eagle" in April 2025, is the Army's first operational hypersonic strike system:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Prime contractor | Lockheed Martin / Dynetics |
| Glide body speed | Mach 5+ |
| Range | 1,725+ miles (estimated) |
| Successful flight test | December 12, 2024 (Cape Canaveral) |
| First battery fielding | December 2025, completing early 2026 |
| Second battery | On schedule for Q4 FY2026 |

After years of testing delays and schedule slips, Dark Eagle achieved a successful end-to-end flight test in December 2024 — a critical milestone that opened the path to fielding. The Army began fielding activities in December 2025, with completion expected in early 2026. The second battery under the Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) rapid fielding effort is on schedule for the fourth quarter of FY2026.

### 3.2 HACM — Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (USAF)

The HACM is a scramjet-powered air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile being developed by Raytheon and Northrop Grumman for the Air Force:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Prime contractor | RTX (Raytheon) / Northrop Grumman |
| Propulsion | Scramjet (air-breathing) |
| Key advantage | Smaller, more maneuverable than boost-glide |
| Status | Development and testing |

HACM represents a different approach than boost-glide weapons like Dark Eagle — air-breathing scramjet propulsion allows sustained hypersonic flight at lower altitudes with greater maneuverability. The Air Force views HACM as more promising than the troubled AGM-183A ARRW program (which was revived with FY2026 procurement funding after earlier cancellation).

### 3.3 CPS — Conventional Prompt Strike (USN)

The Navy's submarine-launched hypersonic weapon shares the common hypersonic glide body with Dark Eagle:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Prime contractor | Lockheed Martin |
| Platform integration | Zumwalt-class destroyers, Virginia-class subs |
| FY2026 RDT&E request | $798.3M |
| Zumwalt integration | Through 2026 |
| Virginia-class integration | Beginning FY2025 |

CPS integration aboard Zumwalt-class destroyers continues through 2026, with Virginia-class submarine integration beginning in FY2025. The shared common glide body with Dark Eagle creates manufacturing efficiencies and reduces unit costs as combined production scales.

### 3.4 Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) — MDA

The GPI is the U.S. answer to the hypersonic defense challenge — a ship-based interceptor optimized to defeat incoming hypersonic weapons during their glide phase:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Prime contractor | Northrop Grumman (selected Sept 2024) |
| Defeated competitor | RTX |
| Launch platform | Aegis destroyers, Aegis Ashore |
| Delivery timeline | Not before 2035 |
| International partner | Japan Ministry of Defense |

Northrop's GPI design features an advanced seeker for threat tracking, a re-ignitable upper-stage engine for threat containment, and a dual engagement mode for multiple altitude regimes. However, the 2035+ delivery timeline means the U.S. will lack a dedicated hypersonic defense interceptor for nearly a decade — relying on existing SM-6 and PAC-3 systems as interim solutions.

### 3.5 US vs. China vs. Russia — Hypersonic Race Assessment

| Country | Key Systems | Status | Assessment |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|
| **China** | DF-ZF glide vehicle (on DF-17), DF-27 | Operational, deployed | Leading in infrastructure and numbers |
| **Russia** | Avangard (Mach 27, ICBM-mounted), Zircon (Mach 8-9, ship-launched), Kinzhal | Deployed (Avangard 2 regiments); Zircon on frigates/subs; Kinzhal combat-used | Deployed but production capacity uncertain |
| **United States** | Dark Eagle, CPS, HACM | Dark Eagle fielding 2025-26; others in development | Behind on deployment, catching up |

The Defense Intelligence Agency's assessment is stark: China leads in both infrastructure and numbers of hypersonic systems, followed by Russia which has pushed for operational deployment. The U.S. lags in fielded systems but is investing heavily in both offensive hypersonics and the GPI defensive interceptor. The technical challenges remain formidable — thermal protection, guidance at hypersonic speeds, and manufacturing precision components at scale.

## 4. Directed Energy Weapons

### 4.1 High Energy Laser Programs

**IFPC-HEL (Valkyrie) — Army:**

The Indirect Fire Protection Capability - High Energy Laser is the Army's flagship directed energy program for fixed and semi-fixed site defense:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Power class | 300 kW class (>250 kW) |
| Developer | Lockheed Martin (HELSI program) |
| Prototype delivery | Q3 FY2025 (4 prototypes) |
| Targets | Cruise missiles, UAS, rockets/artillery/mortars |
| Transition to program of record | FY2025 |

Four IFPC-HEL prototypes were scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of FY2025, marking the system's transition from science project to program of record. The system integrates a vehicle, 300 kW-class laser subsystem, power and thermal management, beam control, and battle management software.

**HELSI (High Energy Laser Scaling Initiative):**

HELSI is the DOD umbrella program driving 300 kW-class laser development. Lockheed Martin's spectral beam combining approach — merging multiple lower-power fiber laser beams into a single high-power beam — has demonstrated the scaling path from 60 kW to 300 kW+. This technology feeds directly into IFPC-HEL/Valkyrie.

**Key Contractors:**
- Lockheed Martin — HELSI prime, IFPC-HEL laser subsystem
- RTX (Raytheon) — competing laser architectures, HELIOS support
- Northrop Grumman — laser weapon development programs

### 4.2 Navy HELIOS System

The High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS) is the Navy's first operationally deployed directed-energy weapon:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Developer | Lockheed Martin |
| Power output | 60-120 kW (modular, expandable) |
| Platform | USS Preble (DDG-88), Arleigh Burke-class |
| Drones destroyed in testing | 4+ (confirmed 2024-2025) |
| Capabilities | Counter-UAS, ISR, sensor dazzling |

USS Preble remains the only Navy ship carrying HELIOS as of early 2026. Testing has successfully engaged and destroyed multiple drones, with expanding test scenarios. The Navy plans to deploy more powerful systems, including the 150 kW Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD) on select ships.

### 4.3 High Power Microwave (HPM)

**IFPC-HPM — Army:**

A transportable, containerized HPM system designed to counter swarms of Group 1 and Group 2 UAS. The system will be paired with IFPC-HEL as part of a layered defense architecture for fixed and semi-fixed sites.

**Raytheon PHASER:**

A high-power microwave system designed to disable drone electronics. HPM weapons offer a complementary capability to lasers — while lasers engage targets one at a time, HPM can disable entire swarms simultaneously. PHASER has been demonstrated in multiple field exercises.

### 4.4 Power and Cooling Challenges

Directed energy weapons face fundamental engineering challenges that limit near-term deployment:

- **Power Generation:** A 300 kW laser requires roughly 1 MW of electrical power including cooling and control systems — far exceeding what most military vehicles can provide. Purpose-built power and thermal management subsystems add size, weight, and cost.
- **Thermal Management:** Waste heat from laser operations must be dissipated rapidly; overheating limits sustained engagement times. This is especially challenging in desert environments and on compact naval platforms.
- **Atmospheric Effects:** Dust, humidity, rain, and fog degrade laser performance. These are operational realities in many theaters where directed energy would be most useful.
- **Magazine Depth vs. Cost Per Shot:** The main economic argument for DEW — near-zero cost per shot versus $3M+ for a PAC-3 interceptor — is compelling only when power is available and cheap. Generator fuel costs and maintenance partially offset savings.

**Deployment Timeline:** IFPC-HEL prototypes are delivering in FY2025 for evaluation. Operational deployment of 300 kW-class systems at scale is likely FY2027-2028 at earliest, with broader fleet integration continuing through the early 2030s.

## 5. Sustainment / MRO Market

### 5.1 Market Size and Structure

Defense sustainment — maintaining, repairing, and overhauling military equipment throughout its lifecycle — represents the largest and most predictable segment of defense spending:

| Market Segment | 2025 Size (Global) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Defense logistics market | $182.5B |
| Military aviation MRO | $44.6B |
| Military vehicle sustainment | $25.8B |
| Defense contracting services (total) | $705.4B |

U.S. defense sustainment spending exceeds $80 billion annually across all services, making it larger than many countries' total defense budgets. The market grows at 5-7% CAGR driven by aging platforms, increasing fleet sizes, and growing operational tempo.

### 5.2 Depot-Level Maintenance

The U.S. military maintains a network of depot-level maintenance facilities:

**Government Depots:**
- **Air Force:** Tinker AFB (Oklahoma), Robins AFB (Georgia), Hill AFB (Utah) — major aircraft overhaul and repair
- **Army:** Anniston Army Depot (Alabama), Red River Army Depot (Texas), Tobyhanna Army Depot (Pennsylvania)
- **Navy:** Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
- **Marine Corps:** Albany (Georgia), Barstow (California)

**Contractor Depot Support:** Private-sector companies perform depot-level work under long-term contracts, often co-located at government facilities. BAE Systems, L3Harris, and DRS Technologies are major depot maintenance contractors.

**50/50 Rule:** By law (10 USC 2466), at least 50% of depot-level maintenance funds must be spent on organic (government) facilities. This creates a structural floor for government depot employment while still leaving substantial contract opportunities.

### 5.3 Performance-Based Logistics (PBL)

PBL contracts shift sustainment risk to contractors by paying for outcomes (availability rates, mission capable rates) rather than individual repair actions:

- Incentivize contractors to invest in reliability improvements
- Provide predictable revenue streams for companies
- Reduce government management overhead
- Create long-duration (5-10+ year) contract relationships

PBL is the preferred sustainment model for complex systems like fighter aircraft, helicopters, and electronic warfare suites. Major PBL contractors include Lockheed Martin (F-35, F-16, C-130), RTX (engines, sensors), and BAE Systems (electronic warfare, vehicle upgrades).

### 5.4 F-35 Sustainment ($1.7T Lifetime Cost)

The F-35 program represents the single largest sustainment challenge and opportunity in military history:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Planned procurement | ~2,500 aircraft |
| Total lifecycle cost | $1.7T+ |
| Sustainment portion | $1.3T (~76% of lifecycle cost) |
| Annual O&S cost | $5B+ (2023, growing with fleet) |
| Cost per tail per year | $7.5M (vs. $6.8M target) |
| Aircraft delivered to date | 1,000+ |
| Components awaiting repair | 10,000+ (above desired levels) |

**ODIN System:** The Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN) is the replacement for the troubled Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) that supports F-35 maintenance, supply chain management, and mission planning. ODIN aims to improve data analytics, predictive maintenance, and parts availability — but has experienced its own development challenges.

**Sustainment Contract (Dec 2025):** The Navy extended a $3.6B F-35 sustainment deal with Lockheed Martin covering ground maintenance, depot activities, supply chain management, and reliability/maintainability engineering.

**Key Challenge:** F-35 sustainment costs remain above targets, with the per-tail-per-year cost at $7.5M versus the $6.8M goal. The growing fleet (1,000+ aircraft and counting) means total annual sustainment spending is on an inexorable upward trajectory. GAO has repeatedly flagged component repair times and depot capacity as systemic issues.

### 5.5 Ship Maintenance Industrial Base

Naval ship maintenance faces a capacity crisis driven by fleet expansion plans, deferred maintenance backlogs, and workforce shortages:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deferred surface ship maintenance backlog | $2.3B (as of Aug 2022) |
| Planned industrial base investment (5-year) | $12.57B |
| Public shipyards | 4 (Norfolk, Puget Sound, Pearl Harbor, Portsmouth) |
| Fleet concentration areas | 5 (Norfolk, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, Puget Sound, Jacksonville) |

A February 2025 GAO report found that the Navy lacks a strategic approach for private-sector industrial base investments. Private shipyard representatives reported having more infrastructure capacity than the Navy was using — except at Pearl Harbor. The Navy's $12.57 billion five-year investment plan aims to modernize public shipyards and expand private-sector partnerships.

**Key Contractors:**

## 6. Ukraine Replenishment

### 6.1 Total U.S. Military Aid

As of January 2025, the United States has provided approximately $31.7 billion in military assistance through 55 Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) notifications since August 2021. This represents equipment drawn directly from U.S. military stockpiles.

### 6.2 Key Systems Drawn Down and Replacement Timelines

| System | Approximate Drawdown | Replacement Status |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Javelin ATGMs | 8,500+ | $1.3B replacement contract; production at 2,400/year, rising to 3,960 |
| Stinger MANPADs | 1,600+ | 1,700 restart order; production restarting after 20-year gap |
| 155mm rounds | 2M+ | Production at 40K/month, targeting 100K/month by mid-2026 |
| HIMARS launchers | 20+ | Production doubled to 96/year |
| GMLRS rockets | Thousands | 14,000/year capacity, targeting 19,000 by FY2028 |
| AMRAAM | Hundreds | Production nearly doubled in 2025; targeting 1,900/year |
| TOW missiles | 1,000+ | Ongoing production |
| M2 Bradley IFVs | 300+ | AMPV and replacement programs |

### 6.3 Industrial Base Surge Capacity Assessment

The Ukraine drawdown exposed critical gaps in U.S. surge capacity:

- **Ammunition:** The 7x increase needed in 155mm production has taken 3+ years and is still not complete. Single-source dependencies (Radford propellant, key forgings) create fragility.
- **Missiles:** Stinger production had to be restarted nearly from scratch. Javelin production is increasing but remains far below maximum theoretical capacity.
- **Vehicles:** Bradley production capacity was limited; Army is investing in organic depot capacity for refurbishment.
- **Air Defense:** Patriot and NASAMS interceptor production is ramping but demand far exceeds near-term supply.

### 6.4 Supplemental Funding and USAI

- **FY2026-2027 NDAA:** Includes $400 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) for procurement of new weapons specifically for Ukraine.
- **PDA Replenishment:** DOD can use replenishment funds to buy exact replacements, newer variants, or invest in industrial base capacity. However, GAO has noted the DoD lacks explicit instructions on prioritizing replacement needs.

### 6.5 NATO PURL Initiative

The Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative represents a new multilateral approach:

- NATO allies and partners have pledged over $4 billion in military equipment and munitions for Ukraine
- Equipment is sourced from U.S. stockpiles
- Allies pay for the equipment; the U.S. backfills with new production
- This mechanism effectively creates additional demand for U.S. defense manufacturers while strengthening allied military capability
- Nordic and Baltic allies (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland) funded a joint $500M PURL package in November 2025

### 6.6 Allied Replenishment Needs

NATO allies face their own replenishment and stockpile-building challenges:

- **United Kingdom:** Increasing defense spending to 2.5% GDP; rebuilding ammunition stocks and investing in AUKUS submarine program
- **Germany:** Special fund (Sondervermogen) of EUR 100B for defense modernization; major Patriot, IRIS-T, and ammunition procurement
- **France:** Increasing 155mm production through Nexter (KNDS); investing in Caesar howitzer and MICA missile production
- **Poland:** Largest European defense spender relative to GDP; ordering HIMARS (100+ units), K2 tanks, FA-50 aircraft, and massive ammunition stockpiles
- **NATO Ammunition Standardization:** Efforts to harmonize 155mm specifications (NATO STANAG 4425) to enable multinational production and stockpiling. The EU's ASAP (Act in Support of Ammunition Production) program is investing EUR 500M to boost European ammunition manufacturing capacity.

## 7. Investment Implications

### 7.1 Key Tickers and Exposure

| Ticker | Company | Munitions/Sustainment Exposure |
|--------|---------|-------------------------------|
| **GD** | General Dynamics | 155mm production (GD-OTS), Abrams sustainment, ammunition plants |
| **LMT** | Lockheed Martin | PAC-3, GMLRS/HIMARS, PrSM, JASSM/LRASM, Javelin (JV), F-35 sustainment, HELIOS, Dark Eagle |
| **RTX** | RTX Corporation | Patriot radar/C2, SM-6, AMRAAM, Tomahawk, Stinger, HACM, GPI (lost to NOC) |
| **NOC** | Northrop Grumman | Tank ammunition, medium caliber, rocket motors, propellants, GPI, B-21 sustainment |
| **OLN** | Olin Corporation | Small caliber ammo (Winchester), Lake City AAP, NGSW 6.8mm transition |
| **CW** | Curtiss-Wright | Naval electronics, aircraft handling systems, nuclear propulsion components |
| **HII** | Huntington Ingalls | Shipbuilding, carrier/submarine maintenance, surface ship repair |
| **BA** | Boeing | PAC-3 seekers, aircraft sustainment, tanker/fighter depot support |

### 7.2 Structural Tailwinds

1. **Multi-year procurement:** $28.8B in MYP authority provides unprecedented demand visibility
2. **Bipartisan support:** Munitions funding has broad congressional support regardless of Ukraine policy shifts
3. **Allied demand:** NATO rearmament creates a second demand vector independent of U.S. budgets
4. **Industrial base investment:** Government co-investment in new facilities reduces company capital risk
5. **Sustainment growth:** F-35 fleet expansion drives ~7% annual sustainment spending growth

### 7.3 Key Risks

1. **Execution risk:** GD-OTS UAPL delays, production ramp timelines slipping
2. **Supply chain fragility:** Single-source propellant (Radford), seeker components (Boeing PAC-3)
3. **Political risk:** Ukraine funding uncertainty under changing administrations
4. **Cost overruns:** F-35 sustainment costs exceeding targets
5. **Technology risk:** Hypersonic programs have long histories of test failures and schedule slips
6. **Workforce:** Specialized ammunition and maintenance workers are scarce; training takes years
