# Defense Prime Contractors: Deep-Dive Analysis

## Executive Summary

The defense prime contractors are experiencing a generational demand supercycle driven by NATO rearmament, Indo-Pacific deterrence requirements, and the urgent need to replenish depleted munitions stockpiles. Combined backlogs across the six major primes (LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, BA, LHX) now exceed $700 billion — representing roughly 2.5 years of aggregate revenue and the highest levels in modern defense history. European allies are spending at rates not seen since the Cold War, with Germany committing a €100 billion special fund and Poland targeting an extraordinary 5% of GDP on defense. The U.S. defense budget has stabilized near $890 billion annually, and multi-year framework agreements for missile production signal sustained demand through the end of the decade. Operating margins are expanding across the sector as production ramps mature and fixed-price contract headwinds (particularly at Boeing) begin to fade. The structural labor shortage — with 25% of the defense workforce at or beyond retirement age — remains the primary constraint on converting record backlogs into revenue.

## Lockheed Martin (LMT)

### Financial Overview

Lockheed Martin is the world's largest pure-play defense contractor by revenue and backlog. The company reported full-year 2025 revenue of **$75.05 billion**, a 6% increase year-over-year, with a record backlog of **$194 billion** — approximately 2.6x annual sales. The market capitalization stood at approximately **$134 billion** as of January 2026.

Full-year 2025 operating margin was approximately **10.3%**, with segment operating profit showing steady improvement throughout the year. Earnings per share came in at approximately $22 on a diluted basis. Free cash flow reached **$6.9 billion**, exceeding prior guidance even after prefunding $860 million in pension obligations.

For 2026, management guided revenue between **$77.5 billion and $80.0 billion**, with segment operating profit growth of more than 25% year-over-year. Free cash flow is anticipated at $6.5-6.8 billion.

### F-35 Lightning II Program

The F-35 remains Lockheed's crown jewel and the largest defense program in history. In 2025, Lockheed delivered a record **191 F-35 fighter jets**, surpassing the previous annual delivery record of 142 aircraft. Management guided deliveries of **156 aircraft for 2026**, reflecting a normalization after clearing the TR-3 technology refresh backlog.

The international order book continues to expand aggressively alongside NATO's rearmament push:

- **12 nations** now operate the F-35, with nearly **1,300 aircraft** in global service
- Italy added 25 aircraft and Denmark added 16 aircraft to their programs of record
- Belgium announced intent to procure 11 additional F-35s
- Finland celebrated the rollout of its first F-35; Norway completed fleet deliveries
- The **Lots 18-19 production contract** was finalized for up to **296 F-35s at $24 billion** — the largest production contracts in program history, with deliveries beginning in 2026

The F-35 sustainment tail is becoming an increasingly significant revenue stream. With 1,300+ aircraft now in service, each requiring decades of maintenance, training systems, and upgrades, sustainment revenue will compound as the fleet ages and expands. The Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) upgrade adds new electronic warfare capabilities, sensor processing power, and weapons integration.

### Missile Defense and Classified Programs

Lockheed Martin's missile defense portfolio is experiencing unprecedented demand growth:

**PAC-3 MSE:** Lockheed achieved record production of more than **600 PAC-3 MSEs** in 2025, with a ramp to **650 per year** underway and a long-term production target of **2,000 per year by 2030**. The U.S. Army awarded a **$9.8 billion PAC-3 MSE contract** in September 2025. PAC-3 MSE provides protection against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, hypersonics, and aircraft.

**THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense):** Lockheed and the Department of War signed a framework agreement to **quadruple THAAD interceptor production** from 96 to **400 interceptors per year**. This requires a multibillion-dollar investment over three years, with Lockheed expanding or modernizing more than 20 facilities across five states.

**Classified Programs and Hypersonics:** Lockheed's Skunk Works division — the advanced development organization behind the U-2, SR-71, F-117, F-22, and F-35 — is actively developing hypersonic weapons capable of speeds exceeding Mach 5. Details remain classified, but classified program revenue has been growing as a share of Lockheed's total sales, and management noted significant classified backlog growth in 2025 earnings calls.

### International Sales and NATO Impact

The NATO 2% GDP spending target has evolved into a 3.5% floor by 2035 (agreed at The Hague Summit). For Lockheed, the primary international beneficiary is the F-35, but international missile defense demand (Patriot/THAAD interoperability) and helicopter sales (CH-53K, Black Hawk variants) also contribute. Approximately 25-30% of Lockheed's revenue is derived from international customers, and this share is expected to grow as European rearmament accelerates.

### Capital Allocation

Lockheed returned **$4.6 billion** to shareholders through the first nine months of 2025 (110% of free cash flow), through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The board authorized an additional **$2 billion for share repurchases**, bringing total authorization to $9.1 billion. The quarterly dividend was raised 5% to **$3.45 per share** ($13.80 annualized), marking 23 consecutive years of dividend growth.

However, a significant capital allocation shift is underway: Lockheed is increasing internal investment to **$5 billion in 2026** (up 35% year-over-year from $3.6 billion in 2025) and notably declined to commit to its historical practice of returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. This signals management's view that the growth opportunity justifies retaining more capital for capacity expansion.

## RTX Corporation (RTX)

### Financial Overview

RTX is the largest aerospace and defense company by revenue, formed from the 2020 merger of Raytheon, United Technologies, and Rockwell Collins. The company reported **$88.6 billion** in full-year 2025 sales, up 10% year-over-year, with adjusted EPS of **$6.29**. The record total backlog reached **$268 billion**, including **$107 billion** tied to defense programs. Market capitalization is approximately **$166 billion**.

For 2026, RTX guided adjusted sales of **$92-93 billion** (5-6% organic growth). The trailing P/E ratio is approximately 38x, and the forward P/E is approximately 29x, reflecting investor expectations for accelerating defense revenue.

### Segment Breakdown

RTX operates through three segments:

**Collins Aerospace (~$28-29B revenue):** The world's largest supplier of avionics, interiors, mechanical systems, and mission systems for both commercial and military aircraft. Collins benefits from both original equipment production and a massive installed base generating aftermarket revenue. Q3 2025 revenue was $7.62 billion (up 8% YoY).

**Pratt & Whitney (~$28-30B revenue):** Military engines (F135 for F-35, F100 for F-15/F-16) and commercial engines, including the troubled GTF family. Q3 2025 revenue was $8.42 billion (up 16% YoY), driven by strong commercial OE and aftermarket demand.

**Raytheon (~$26-27B revenue):** Missiles, defense systems, sensors, and cybersecurity. Q3 2025 revenue was $7.05 billion (up 10% YoY). The segment posted a book-to-bill ratio of **2.27x** in Q3 2025 — meaning new orders were more than double shipments.

### Patriot Missile System and Munitions Demand Surge

Patriot demand has surged to levels not seen since the system's deployment in the Gulf War. RTX secured a **$50 billion umbrella contract** from the Defense Logistics Agency for Patriot missile defense systems, spare parts, services, and sustainment over a 20-year period for U.S. and international customers. Additionally, Raytheon was awarded a **$1.7 billion contract** to supply Spain with four Patriot fire units.

In February 2026, Raytheon signed **five landmark framework agreements** with the Department of War to dramatically increase missile production:

- **Tomahawk:** Production increasing to more than **1,000 per year**
- **AMRAAM:** Production increasing to at least **1,900 per year** (nearly doubled in 2025 from 2024; $760M contract awarded September 2025)
- **SM-6:** Production increasing to more than **500 per year**
- **SM-3 Block IB and SM-3 Block IIA:** Significant production increases

These up-to-seven-year deals represent 2-4x increases over existing production rates for many of these munitions — a direct consequence of depleted stockpiles and the NATO rearmament wave.

### Pratt & Whitney GTF Engine Issues and Recovery

The Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (PW1000G) engine recall remains a significant overhang. In 2023, Pratt disclosed a rare powder-metal defect that could cause cracking, prompting inspections of 600-700 engines through 2026. As of late 2025, **835 PW1000G-powered aircraft** were in storage globally.

However, recovery is underway. The number of aircraft-on-ground due to the recall declined in Q4 2025 and is **down 20% from peak levels**. Pratt delivered **1,055 turbofans** in 2025, up 6% year-over-year. The **GTF Advantage** — a more durable PW1100G variant with improved fuel efficiency — has entered final production, with initial shipments to Airbus expected in early 2026. Full GTF recovery is expected to extend through **2030**.

The GTF headwind, while painful, creates a large future aftermarket revenue stream as engines cycle through inspection and overhaul.

### International Order Book

RTX's international defense exposure is broad. International orders represented **26% of Boeing Defense backlog** but an even higher share at RTX given Patriot's global customer base. Key international Patriot customers include Germany, Poland, Spain, Romania, Sweden, and multiple Middle Eastern nations. The AMRAAM is operated by 40+ nations.

## Northrop Grumman (NOC)

### Financial Overview

Northrop Grumman is the most classified-program-heavy of the defense primes, with the B-21 stealth bomber and Sentinel ICBM as its franchise programs. The company reported 2025 revenue guidance of **$41.7-41.9 billion** and EPS of **$25.65-26.05**. The record backlog reached **$95.7 billion**, representing approximately 2.3x annual sales. Market capitalization is approximately **$98 billion**.

For 2026, management guided sales of **$43.5-44.0 billion**, with segment operating margin improving to the **12% range**. The growth is driven by B-21 production ramp, SDA satellite deliveries, and continued strength in defense systems.

### B-21 Raider Program

The B-21 Raider is the world's first sixth-generation strategic bomber and the most significant airframe program since the B-2 Spirit. Key milestones:

- **First flight:** November 10, 2023 at Plant 42, Palmdale, California
- **Second aircraft maiden flight:** September 11, 2025
- **Current status:** Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP), with three lots contracted
- **Production acceleration:** Northrop expects to finalize a deal with the Air Force to accelerate B-21 production, supported by a **$4.5 billion congressional appropriation**
- **USAF commitment:** At least **100 B-21s**, potentially up to 150
- **Financial impact timeline:** Management stressed that production acceleration requires $2-3 billion in investment, with most volume and financial benefits accruing in the **2027-2029 timeframe** rather than materially impacting 2026

The LRIP phase notionally includes 21 aircraft over five lots, followed by full-rate production. The B-21 is designed for nuclear and conventional strike, electronic warfare, and ISR missions using open architecture systems.

### Sentinel ICBM Program (LGM-35A)

Sentinel replaces the aging Minuteman III ICBM fleet that has been in service since the 1970s. The program has experienced significant cost overruns:

- **Original estimate (2020):** $77.7 billion
- **Nunn-McCurdy breach:** January 2024, when costs exceeded baseline by more than 25%
- **Revised estimate (July 2024):** **$140.9 billion** — an **81% increase** from the original baseline
- **Current status:** The Air Force is restructuring the program, simplifying the ground segment to reduce costs. A new acquisition strategy is expected around 2026
- **Timeline:** Production not expected until later in the decade; initial operational capability pushed into the 2030s

Despite the cost overruns, the DOD completed a Nunn-McCurdy review in July 2024 and determined the program "met the statutory criteria to continue." Sentinel remains a "must-have" as the nation's land-based nuclear deterrent. For Northrop, this represents decades of sustained revenue regardless of the cost restructuring.

### Space Systems

Northrop's space segment is a major differentiator, with approximately **$11 billion** in 2025 revenue:

- **SDA Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture:** Northrop is under contract to deliver **116 transport layer satellites** and was awarded **$764 million** for 18 Tranche 3 tracking layer satellites
- **James Webb Space Telescope heritage:** Northrop served as the prime contractor for JWST, establishing deep expertise in complex space systems
- **Cygnus cargo vehicle:** Ongoing deliveries to the International Space Station
- **Strategic communications and restricted space programs:** Primary growth drivers within the segment

### Ammunition and Propulsion

Northrop's Defense Systems segment includes ground-based weapon systems, munitions, and the IBCS (Integrated Battle Command System). The company is expanding propulsion systems capacity, and this segment's growth is being driven by demand for military ammunition and solid rocket motor production.

## General Dynamics (GD)

### Financial Overview

General Dynamics is unique among the primes for its combination of defense and luxury business jet operations. The company reported 2025 revenue of **$52.6 billion** (up 10.1% YoY), with net earnings of **$4.2 billion** (up 11.3%) and diluted EPS of **$15.45** (up 13.4%). The backlog reached **$118 billion**, with total estimated contract value of **$179 billion** — up 24% from a year earlier. The full-year book-to-bill ratio was **1.5x**. Market capitalization is approximately **$92 billion**.

For 2026, GD guided revenue of **$54.3-54.8 billion** and EPS of **$16.10-16.20**.

### Gulfstream Aerospace

Gulfstream is General Dynamics' crown jewel commercial business, providing diversification from defense spending cycles. In 2025, Gulfstream delivered **158 aircraft** (136 large-cabin, 22 midsize), with full-year Aerospace segment revenue reaching approximately **$13 billion** (up 16.5% YoY). Management targets **160 deliveries** in 2026, with Aerospace revenue projected at **$13.6 billion** and operating margin around **14%**.

Key product developments:
- **G700:** 50th delivery reached, one year after certification
- **G800:** First deliveries began in 2025, featuring ultra-long-range capability
- **G650 wind-down:** Last G650 deliveries occurred in mid-2025
- Strong business jet demand cycle continues, supported by corporate fleet replacement needs

### Combat Systems

General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment produces the M1 Abrams main battle tank, Stryker armored vehicles, and various munitions systems. The segment benefits from:
- **Abrams tank upgrades:** The M1A2 SEPv3/v4 upgrades for U.S. and allied forces
- **Stryker modernization:** Vehicle upgrades and new variants
- **European demand:** NATO allies are expanding armored vehicle inventories in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict
- **Ammunition production:** Expanding capacity for various caliber ammunition

### Marine Systems (NASSCO/Electric Boat)

General Dynamics is the sole prime contractor for the **Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine** (SSBN), the Navy's highest priority acquisition program:

- **SSBN-826 (USS District of Columbia):** Approximately **60% complete** as of late 2025; planned delivery in October 2027
- **SSBN-827 (USS Wisconsin):** Keel laid in September 2025; under active construction
- All major modules for the first boat are expected at Groton for assembly and test by end of 2026
- The Columbia class replaces the aging Ohio-class SSBNs and carries the nation's sea-based nuclear deterrent
- Electric Boat received a **$5.1 billion** contract for Columbia-class construction

Additionally, GD's NASSCO shipyard in San Diego builds expeditionary sea base ships and other surface combatants, while Bath Iron Works builds Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.

### GDIT (General Dynamics Information Technology)

GDIT serves every major U.S. government agency, defense organization, and intelligence community entity with consulting, technology, and mission services. The segment has approximately **30,000 employees** and achieved a **1.2x book-to-bill ratio** in 2025, with strong award activity across both GDIT and Mission Systems. GDIT provides cybersecurity, cloud, AI/ML, and enterprise IT services.

### Backlog Analysis

General Dynamics' $118 billion backlog breaks down across four operating segments, with Marine Systems holding the largest share (driven by Columbia-class and Virginia-class submarine programs). The total estimated contract value of $179 billion (up 24% YoY) includes backlog, unfunded orders, and unexercised options — providing exceptional long-term revenue visibility. Q4 2025 orders alone totaled **$22.4 billion** with a **1.6x book-to-bill**.

---

## Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BA)

### Financial Overview

Boeing's Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment is the troubled member of the defense prime group, burdened by years of fixed-price contract losses that have destroyed billions in shareholder value. In 2025, BDS posted revenue of **$27.2 billion** (up 14% from $23.9 billion in 2024) with an operating margin of **-6.8%** (improved dramatically from -41.9% in 2024). Backlog rose to a record **$85 billion**, with 26% of orders from international customers.

Boeing's overall market capitalization is approximately **$191 billion**, but this reflects both the defense unit and the much larger commercial airplane business. Boeing does not currently pay a dividend (yield: 0%). The trailing P/E ratio exceeds 100x, reflecting ongoing profitability challenges.

### F/A-18 Wind-Down and Successor Programs

The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet production line is winding down, with the last deliveries expected in the 2025-2026 timeframe. Boeing is positioning for the Navy's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, but has lost the Air Force NGAD competition to competitors.

**T-7A Red Hawk:** The Air Force's next-generation trainer has been a financial disaster for Boeing. The fixed-price EMD contract has generated cumulative losses exceeding **$2 billion**, with a **$700 million charge** in Q4 2024 alone driven by higher-than-estimated costs on production lots in 2026 and beyond. Boeing is working to stabilize production costs and hopes to reprice future lots.

**MQ-25 Stingray:** The Navy's carrier-based autonomous refueling drone is in development. The program has contributed to Boeing's fixed-price losses but represents a potentially transformative capability for carrier aviation.

### KC-46 Tanker

The KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tanker has been Boeing's most costly fixed-price program mistake. The aircraft took a **$565 million charge** at the end of 2025, with total program losses measured in the billions. Boeing blamed higher manufacturing costs and disruptions from the seven-week 2024 workers' strike. However, Boeing expects to negotiate repricing on future lots, which could significantly improve the program's economics going forward.

### Space Programs

**SLS (Space Launch System):** Boeing is the prime contractor for the SLS core stage, which powered the Artemis I mission. The program has faced significant schedule delays and cost overruns.

**Starliner:** The CST-100 Starliner commercial crew vehicle has been plagued by technical issues, including helium leaks during its first crewed mission in 2024 that forced the crew to return on a SpaceX Dragon. Starliner contributed to Boeing's defense segment losses.

### Turnaround Prospects

Under CEO Kelly Ortberg (who took over in August 2024), Boeing is prioritizing operational stability, quality improvement, and working through its fixed-price contract portfolio. The key thesis for Boeing Defense improvement includes:

1. **Fixed-price contract burn-off:** The most problematic contracts (KC-46, T-7A early lots, Starliner) are finite and will eventually be completed or repriced
2. **Revenue growth:** The 14% revenue increase in 2025 and $85 billion record backlog demonstrate demand strength
3. **Margin recovery:** Operating margin improved from -41.9% to -6.8% in one year — still negative, but trending toward profitability
4. **New program positioning:** Boeing is competing for the F-47 (NGAD replacement) and next-generation rotorcraft programs

## L3Harris Technologies (LHX)

### Financial Overview

L3Harris is the sixth-largest U.S. defense contractor by revenue, formed from the 2019 merger of L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation, with the transformative 2023 acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne adding solid rocket motor production. The company reported 2025 revenue of **$21.9 billion** (up 5% organically), with a record backlog of more than **$38 billion** and an overall book-to-bill ratio of **1.3x**. Market capitalization is approximately **$54 billion**.

For 2026, L3Harris guided revenue of **$23.0-23.5 billion** (7% organic growth at the midpoint), with segment operating margin expected in the **low 16% range** — the highest margins among the six primes.

### Communication Systems and Electronic Warfare

L3Harris is the leading provider of tactical radios, satellite communication terminals, and electronic warfare systems to the U.S. and allied militaries:

- **$300 million contract** to deliver two Gulfstream G550 aircraft provisioned for electromagnetic warfare systems to Italy — the first U.S.-approved EA-37B sale to an international ally
- Selected for the **U.S. Air Force Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC)** program, providing assured communications for the E-4C fleet
- Contract to develop a **next-generation security processor** to secure communication devices globally
- **$62.7 million contract** to maintain American space surveillance systems

### ISR and Space/Airborne Systems

L3Harris announced a strategic reorganization from four segments to three, creating a dedicated **Space & Mission Systems** unit expected to drive approximately **$11.5 billion in 2026 revenue**. Key ISR capabilities include:

- WESCAM MX-series surveillance and targeting systems (contract for 16 MX-20 units for Canada's P-8A fleet)
- Airborne ISR platform missionization
- Space-based sensors and payloads

### Aerojet Rocketdyne Integration and Solid Rocket Motors

The $4.7 billion Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition (completed July 2023) has been transformative. In 2025, Aerojet Rocketdyne delivered **12% organic revenue growth** with revenue exceeding **$2.8 billion** and margin of **12.5%** — making it the fastest-growing segment.

L3Harris has broken ground on **five new solid rocket motor "Factories of the Future"** in Virginia, backed by a **$1 billion Department of War investment** to accelerate production capacity. The company also received a follow-on production contract valued up to **$200 million** for GMLRS (Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System) propulsion units.

However, the solid rocket motor business is undergoing strategic change. L3Harris announced:
- **Sale of 60% controlling stake** in its Space Propulsion and Power Systems business to AE Industrial Partners for **$845 million**
- Plans to pursue an **IPO of its Missile Solutions business** in the second half of 2026
- The Pentagon announced a **$1 billion investment** in the L3Harris spinoff rocket motor firm

These moves reflect the antitrust concerns around Aerojet Rocketdyne's near-monopoly position in solid rocket motors and L3Harris's desire to unlock value while retaining strategic alignment.

### Signals Intelligence and Electronic Warfare

L3Harris maintains deep capabilities in SIGINT (signals intelligence), ELINT (electronic intelligence), and electronic warfare across air, ground, sea, and space domains. The company's electronic protection and electronic attack systems are embedded across multiple U.S. and allied platforms. This classified portfolio is a steady, high-margin revenue source.

## Industry-Wide Analysis

### NATO 2% GDP Spending and the Rearmament Wave

The NATO defense spending landscape has undergone a historic transformation:

- **All 32 NATO allies** are now expected to meet or exceed the 2% of GDP defense spending target in 2025, compared to only three allies in 2014
- At The Hague Summit, NATO heads of state agreed to spend **3.5% of GDP on core defense by 2035**, plus **1.5% on defense-related projects** (military infrastructure, resilience, defense industry support)
- Only **three allies** (Poland, Greece, and Estonia) currently meet the new 5% combined target

**Key Country Ramp-Ups:**

| Country | 2025 Defense Spending (% GDP) | Target / Trajectory |
|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Poland | ~4.5-5.0% | Targeting **5% of GDP in 2026** — highest in NATO |
| Greece | ~3.5% | Historically high spender, sustained |
| United States | ~3.4% | Stable at ~$890B/year |
| Germany | ~2.4% | Targeting **3.5% by 2029**; €95B FY2025 budget (+16% YoY), backed by €100B special fund |
| United Kingdom | ~2.3% | Committed to increase, specific timeline TBD |
| France | ~2.1% | Loi de Programmation Militaire targeting €413B through 2030 |
| Denmark | ~2.0% | Recently reached 2% for first time |
| Canada | ~1.7-2.0% | Under pressure to reach 2%, increasing slowly |

**Germany's rearmament** is particularly significant: the FY2025 defense budget of €95 billion (+16% YoY) is financed in part by a special constitutional fund of €100 billion, with projected spending reaching **€162 billion by FY2029**. This represents the most dramatic German military buildup since reunification.

**Poland** is the standout, aiming to bring defense spending to **5% of GDP in 2026** — the highest ratio among all 32 allies. Poland has ordered F-35s, HIMARS, Patriot systems, K2 tanks, K9 howitzers, and Apache helicopters in one of the most aggressive modernization programs globally.

### European Rearmament Wave

Beyond the NATO 2% framework, Europe is experiencing a broader rearmament driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict:

- **Germany:** €100 billion Zeitenwende special fund; massive Bundeswehr modernization including F-35 procurement, Patriot/IRIS-T air defense, naval frigates
- **Poland:** 4-5% GDP spending; orders spanning American, Korean, and European equipment worth tens of billions
- **Nordic states:** Finland and Sweden (new NATO members) are integrating military capabilities and increasing budgets
- **France:** €413 billion military programming law through 2030 emphasizing nuclear deterrent modernization, space, and cyber
- **Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Greece:** All increasing procurement budgets for fighter aircraft, air defense, and armored vehicles

This European spending wave disproportionately benefits U.S. primes because European defense industrial capacity cannot ramp fast enough to meet demand, and interoperability requirements favor American systems (F-35, Patriot, HIMARS).

### U.S. Defense Budget Trajectory

The U.S. defense budget has stabilized at near-record levels:

- **FY2025:** ~$886 billion authorized
- **FY2026 Request:** $892.6 billion (near-flat nominal growth)
- **FY2026 NDAA Enacted:** $890.6 billion — **$8 billion more than requested**, with $8.9 billion and $3.7 billion additional for procurement and RDT&E respectively
- **FY2027-2030 trajectory:** Consensus expects modest real growth (1-3% annually) driven by China deterrence, nuclear modernization, and munitions recapitalization

The budget composition is shifting toward **procurement and munitions** at the expense of R&D, reflecting the urgency to replenish depleted stocks and deliver weapons systems already in development. Multi-year framework agreements (Lockheed's PAC-3/THAAD, RTX's five missile programs) provide demand certainty beyond annual appropriations cycles.

### Margin Expansion Trends

Defense sector operating margins are on an expansion trajectory:

- **Defense tech operating margins** expanded over **230 basis points in 2025**, with another **120 basis points expected in 2026**
- L3Harris leads the primes with segment margins in the **low 16% range** for 2026
- Northrop Grumman is targeting **12%+ segment operating margin**
- Lockheed and RTX operate in the **10-11% range** at the consolidated level
- General Dynamics runs approximately **10.3%** consolidated
- Boeing Defense remains the outlier at **negative margins**, though rapidly improving

Margin expansion drivers include: maturation of production learning curves, fixed-price contract burn-off (particularly Boeing), higher-margin aftermarket/sustainment revenue growth, software-defined platform economics, and volume leverage as production ramps.

### Backlog-to-Revenue and Book-to-Bill Trends

Record backlogs across the sector provide exceptional revenue visibility:

| Company | Backlog | Backlog/Revenue Ratio | FY2025 Book-to-Bill |
|---------|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| RTX | $268B | ~3.0x | >1.5x (Raytheon segment 2.27x) |
| LMT | $194B | ~2.6x | >1.0x |
| GD | $118B | ~2.2x | 1.5x |
| NOC | $95.7B | ~2.3x | >1.0x |
| BA (BDS) | $85B | ~3.1x | >1.0x |
| LHX | $38B+ | ~1.7x | 1.3x |
| **Total** | **~$799B** | **~2.5x avg** | |

Book-to-bill ratios above 1.0x across the board mean the backlog continues to grow — orders are outpacing deliveries. RTX's Raytheon segment book-to-bill of 2.27x is particularly striking, indicating demand for missiles and defense systems is dramatically exceeding current production capacity.

Major primes are guiding **8-10% EPS growth CAGR through FY2028**, supported by backlog conversion, margin expansion, and continued strong order flow.

### Labor Shortages in Defense Manufacturing

The defense industrial base faces a structural workforce crisis:

- **25% of the defense workforce** is at or beyond retirement age
- **75% of companies** struggle to find qualified talent, particularly in AI, cybersecurity, and advanced manufacturing
- Jobs requiring **security clearance** have increased by almost **1,000%** since 2014, while qualified candidates have risen by less than **10%**
- Many small and medium-tier suppliers reduced workforce during the pandemic and have not rebuilt capacity
- The constraint is not just volume but **qualification** — skilled machinists, welders, systems engineers, and cleared professionals are chronically undersupplied

This labor bottleneck is the primary constraint on converting record backlogs into revenue. Companies are investing heavily in workforce development, automation, and facility expansion, but the gap will take years to close.

### Supply Chain Bottlenecks

Specific supply chain constraints limit production growth across the sector:

- **Solid rocket motors:** Limited supplier base (Aerojet Rocketdyne dominance, Northrop propulsion), constraining missile production ramps
- **Guidance sensors and seekers:** Specialty components with long lead times and few second sources
- **Energetic materials:** Explosive compounds and propellants face capacity limitations
- **Specialized machining capacity:** Precision manufacturing for aerospace-grade components
- **Titanium and specialty metals:** Supply disruptions from sanctions and mine concentration
- **Microelectronics:** Radiation-hardened and ITAR-compliant chips face limited foundry capacity

The industry expects to continue navigating supply chain instability through 2026 and beyond, with companies investing in vertical integration, dual-sourcing, and new production facilities.

## Investment Implications

The defense prime contractors are positioned at the beginning of a multi-year spending supercycle. The convergence of NATO rearmament, Indo-Pacific deterrence, nuclear modernization, and munitions recapitalization creates a demand environment that is structurally different from the post-sequestration era. Record backlogs of nearly $800 billion collectively, book-to-bill ratios consistently above 1.0x, and multi-year framework agreements provide unusual revenue visibility.

The key risk is execution: labor shortages, supply chain bottlenecks, and fixed-price contract losses (particularly at Boeing) remain headwinds. Companies that can ramp production capacity fastest will capture disproportionate value. Lockheed's $5 billion internal investment plan for 2026 and RTX's multi-year missile production frameworks suggest the primes are investing aggressively to meet demand.

Margin expansion should continue as production learning curves mature, aftermarket/sustainment revenue grows, and software-defined platforms increase pricing leverage. L3Harris stands out on margins, while RTX and Lockheed lead on absolute backlog scale.
