# Uranium Mining, Enrichment & the Nuclear Fuel Cycle

**Investment Research Report | February 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

The uranium market is in a structural deficit that is unlikely to resolve before the end of the decade. Primary mine supply covers roughly 75% of global reactor requirements, secondary sources (inventories, underfeeding, tails re-enrichment) have been drawn down to historic lows, and every stage of the fuel cycle -- conversion, enrichment, fabrication -- faces capacity constraints. Spot U3O8 breached $100/lb in January 2026 for the first time since February 2024, while long-term contract prices sit in the $75-85/lb range with producers targeting ceilings of $130-140/lb. The ban on Russian enriched uranium imports, combined with AI-driven electricity demand growth, adds structural tailwinds that could sustain elevated prices through the 2026-2030 period.

## 1. Uranium Pricing

### Spot Market

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Spot price (Jan 2026 peak) | ~$100/lb U3O8 |
| TradeTech weekly indicator (Jan 16, 2026) | $85.15/lb |
| TradeTech monthly Exchange Value (Dec 31, 2025) | $81.70/lb |
| 2024 trough | ~$60/lb |
| 2024 peak (Feb) | $106/lb |

Spot uranium climbed above $100/lb in January 2026, recovering from the mid-2024 correction. The market is primarily traded over-the-counter between buyers and sellers, with spot prices reflecting near-term delivery negotiations.

### Long-Term Contract Pricing

Long-term contract prices have historically traded at a ~10% premium to spot since 1996, but the relationship has inverted -- spot now leads term by $8-10/lb. Cameco is targeting market-reference contracts with ceilings at $130-140/lb, signaling producer confidence in sustained higher prices. Years of utility under-contracting leave significant coverage gaps; 2026 is expected to see accelerated procurement activity that could drive term prices higher.

## 2. Supply-Demand Fundamentals

### Global Demand

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 reactor requirements | ~68,920 tU (~179M lbs U3O8) |
| Operable reactors worldwide | ~440 |
| Reactors under construction | 63-68 (66-74 GWe) |
| Reactors planned | 108 (~103 GWe) |
| Reactors proposed | 359 |
| 2040 projected demand | ~150,000 tU |

AI-driven data center electricity demand is emerging as a material incremental driver. Over 63% of surveyed uranium investors believe AI-related consumption will become a significant factor in nuclear planning within the next decade.

### Global Supply

| Source | Annual Volume |
|--------|--------------|
| Primary mine production | ~140-150M lbs U3O8 |
| Secondary sources (inventories, underfeeding) | ~5% of demand (declining) |
| **Annual supply gap** | **~30-40M lbs** |

Government uranium inventories have been largely depleted after decades of drawdown. Western utility stockpiles sit at multi-decade lows, with many utilities holding less than 18 months of forward coverage. Underfeeding from enrichment plants is decreasing as global enrichment capacity tightens, and tails re-enrichment remains economically marginal and geopolitically complicated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

By 2035, existing uranium mines are projected to cover only 40% of reactor demand, creating a widening gap that requires significant new mine investment.

---

## 3. Major Uranium Producers

### Kazatomprom (KAP.IL / KAP.L)

The world's largest uranium producer, accounting for over 40% of global output via extensive ISR operations in Kazakhstan.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 production (100% basis) | 25,000-26,500 tU |
| 2025 actual output growth | +11-13% YoY |
| 2026 production target (100% basis) | 27,500-29,000 tU |
| 2026 vs subsoil use agreements | ~10% below 100% levels |
| Sulphuric acid supply (2026) | Stable |

Kazatomprom announced it does not view the current supply-demand balance as sufficient to incentivize a return to 100% production levels. The company maintains a robust inventory position and disciplined sales strategy, retaining flexibility to respond to market developments. The reduction in planned 2026 output is bullish for pricing, as it removes potential supply from the market.

### Cameco Corporation (CCJ / CCO.TO)

The second-largest Western uranium producer, operating flagship mines in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 production guidance | Up to 20M lbs U3O8 (100% basis) |
| McArthur River/Key Lake (revised) | 14-15M lbs (down from 18M lbs) |
| Cigar Lake (potential) | Up to 19M lbs |
| 2026 realized price growth | Expected +5-10% |
| Production shortfall driver | Slower ground freezing, development delays |

Cameco's McArthur River production cuts -- driven by ground freezing delays and labor constraints -- tighten supply further. The company's long-term contract book positions it to benefit from rising term prices, with realized prices expected to climb another 5-10% in 2026.

### NexGen Energy (NXE / NXE.TO)

Developer of the Rook I project, the largest development-stage uranium project in Canada, located in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual production capacity | Up to 30M lbs U3O8 |
| Mine life | 24 years |
| CNSC hearing dates | Nov 29, 2025 & Feb 9-13, 2026 |
| Construction start | Immediately following positive federal decision |
| First production | Estimated ~4-5 years post-approval |

The February 2026 CNSC commission hearing is the critical near-term catalyst. A positive decision would clear the path for construction of the first new large-scale uranium mine in Canada since Cigar Lake.

### Denison Mines (DNN / DML.TO)

Developer of the Wheeler River project, the largest undeveloped uranium deposit in the eastern Athabasca Basin, featuring Phoenix (ISR) and Gryphon (underground) deposits.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Construction readiness | Q1 2026 (pending CNSC approval) |
| Construction timeline | ~2 years |
| Targeted first production | Mid-2028 |
| Financial position | $700M+ (cash, physical uranium, investments) |
| Significance | First ISR uranium mine in Athabasca Basin |

With CNSC public hearings concluded and Saskatchewan provincial construction approval received, Denison is positioned for a series of positive catalysts in early 2026.

### Uranium Energy Corp (UEC)

The largest diversified North American-focused uranium company, operating ISR hub-and-spoke platforms in Texas and Wyoming.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Christensen Ranch production (as of Oct 2025) | ~199,000 lbs accumulated |
| Burke Hollow status | Major construction milestones complete |
| ISR platforms | 3 (South Texas + Wyoming) |
| Licensed/permitted satellite projects | 7 |
| FY2026 outlook | Increasing output from Burke Hollow + Christensen Ranch |

UEC's low-cost ISR model provides operating leverage to uranium prices. The Burke Hollow ramp-up in South Texas adds a second production hub alongside Wyoming operations.

### Energy Fuels (UUUU / EFR.TO)

Operates the White Mesa Mill in Utah -- the only conventional uranium mill operating in the United States -- with a parallel rare earth processing business.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 2025 U3O8 production | >1M lbs (exceeded guidance) |
| Dec 2025 production rate | ~350,000 lbs/month |
| H1 2026 expected rate | ~250,000 lbs/month |
| H2 2026 shift | Commercial-scale heavy rare earth production |
| Rare earth capacity | 48 mt Dy oxide + 14 mt Tb oxide annually |

Energy Fuels is unique as a dual uranium/rare earth play. The rare earth pivot provides downside protection and optionality while uranium production generates near-term revenue.

## 4. Mine Restarts & New Projects Pipeline

| Project | Owner | Location | Type | Status | Target Production |
|---------|-------|----------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Langer Heinrich | Paladin Energy (75%) | Namibia | Conventional | Restarted 2024, ramping | 6M lbs/yr by end 2026 |
| Tumas | Deep Yellow | Namibia | Conventional | Advancing | 3.6M lbs/yr by Q3 2027 |
| Rook I (Arrow) | NexGen Energy | Saskatchewan | Underground | CNSC hearing Feb 2026 | 30M lbs/yr |
| Wheeler River (Phoenix) | Denison Mines | Saskatchewan | ISR | Construction-ready Q1 2026 | First production mid-2028 |
| Burke Hollow | UEC | Texas | ISR | Construction milestones complete | Ramping FY2026 |
| Christensen Ranch | UEC | Wyoming | ISR | Producing | Expanding wellfields |

Even the fastest mine restarts cannot materialize meaningful new supply before 2027-2028, creating a multi-year gap before supply relief arrives.

---

## 5. Production Cost Curve

### By Mining Method

| Method | Typical Cost Range | Share of Global Production |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| ISR (Kazakhstan) | $15-25/lb | ~50-55% |
| ISR (United States) | $23-30/lb | ~3-5% |
| Underground (Athabasca Basin) | $25-40/lb | ~15-20% |
| Open pit (Namibia, Australia) | $30-50/lb | ~10-15% |
| Conventional mill (U.S.) | $40-60/lb | ~2-5% |
| Byproduct recovery | Variable | ~5% |

### By Cost Tier (IAEA/NEA Classification)

| Cost Category | USD/kgU | USD/lb U3O8 (approx.) |
|---------------|---------|----------------------|
| Low cost | < $40/kgU | < $15/lb |
| Medium cost | < $80/kgU | < $31/lb |
| High cost | < $130/kgU | < $50/lb |
| Very high cost | < $260/kgU | < $100/lb |

Kazakhstan's ISR operations dominate the low end of the cost curve, which is why Kazatomprom's production discipline is so critical to price formation. At $80-100/lb spot, nearly all global uranium projects are economic, incentivizing restarts and new development -- but lead times of 5-10+ years mean new supply arrives slowly.

---

## 6. The Conversion Bottleneck

Uranium conversion (U3O8 to UF6) is the tightest link in the fuel cycle, with only four major Western facilities operating at ~91% utilization.

| Facility | Operator | Location | Capacity |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| COMURHEX / Philippe Coste | Orano | France | 15,000 tU/yr (ramping from 10,000 tU) |
| Port Hope | Cameco | Canada | ~12,500 tU/yr |
| Metropolis | ConverDyn | United States | ~7,000 tU/yr (restarted 2023) |
| Springfields | Westinghouse | UK | Expansion planned: 5,000 tU/yr by 2031 |

Buffer inventories that once bridged supply gaps have been drawn down. The World Nuclear Association forecasts 5.5-7.7% CAGR in conversion requirements through 2040. ConverDyn's Metropolis restart in 2023 and Springfields' expansion plans help, but new capacity will be needed by the late 2020s to meet growing demand.

---

## 7. Enrichment: The Geopolitical Chokepoint

### Global Enrichment Capacity (~60M SWU/yr total)

| Company | Country | Capacity | Market Share |
|---------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Rosatom/TENEX | Russia | ~27M SWU/yr | ~44% |
| Urenco | UK/DE/NL/US | ~10M SWU/yr | ~30% (Western) |
| Orano | France | ~7.5M SWU/yr | ~12% |
| CNNC | China | Growing | Domestic focus |
| Centrus Energy (LEU) | United States | Expanding | <1% (growing) |

### Russian Enrichment Ban

The U.S. Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act (signed 2024) bans Russian enriched uranium purchases starting in 2028, with waivers available until then. Russia responded with a temporary counter-ban through end-2025, though TENEX has received special export licenses to fulfill existing contracts. Russia supplies approximately 20-30% of enriched uranium used by U.S. and European utilities.

Western enrichment capacity gaps will take at least 5-7 years to fully close, prolonging market tightness.

### Western Capacity Expansion

**Urenco** is adding 2.5M SWU of new capacity globally:
- Three new cascades installed at the New Mexico facility in 2025 (all ahead of schedule)
- 700,000 SWU target in the U.S. by 2027
- 1.5M SWU expansion at Almelo (Netherlands) by 2030
- Commercial LEU+ production anticipated by mid-2026

**Centrus Energy (LEU):**
- Current HALEU production: 900 kg/yr at Piketon, Ohio (DOE contract extended through June 2026)
- $900M DOE award (Jan 2026) for commercial-scale HALEU expansion
- Total potential contract value: $1.07B with options
- First new production capacity: expected 2029
- $2.3B in LEU purchase commitments from utilities (contingent on financing)

---

## 8. HALEU: Fuel for Advanced Reactors

High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), enriched to 5-20% U-235, is required by most advanced reactor and SMR designs. Currently, the only Western HALEU production comes from Centrus Energy's demonstration cascade at 900 kg/yr -- orders of magnitude below projected demand.

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Current Western HALEU production | 900 kg/yr (Centrus, Piketon OH) |
| DOE cumulative HALEU delivered | 900 kg milestone achieved |
| Centrus expansion timeline | Commercial-scale by 2029 |
| DOE funding committed | $900M (plus $170M options) |
| Primary demand drivers | TerraPower, X-energy, Kairos Power, Oklo |
| Russian alternative | Previously sole commercial HALEU source; now banned for import |

The HALEU supply gap is the single largest bottleneck for advanced reactor deployment. Without domestic or allied enrichment capacity, SMR and advanced reactor timelines remain constrained. Centrus is the primary Western play on this theme.

---

## 9. Physical Uranium & Investment Vehicles

### Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN / SRUUF)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total holdings | ~78.4M lbs U3O8 |
| Portfolio value | ~$7.28B (C$9.9B) |
| Unit price (Feb 4, 2026) | $20.77 (USD) |
| 2026 Q1 purchases | 3.65M lbs |
| Role in market | Largest physical uranium fund; acts as marginal buyer |

Sprott's at-the-market purchasing program acts as a structural demand floor. When units trade at a premium to NAV, Sprott issues new units and uses proceeds to buy physical uranium, directly tightening the spot market.

### Uranium ETFs

| ETF | AUM | Holdings | Expense Ratio | 1-Year Return | Key Feature |
|-----|-----|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| URA (Global X) | ~$5.0B | 50 companies | 0.69% | +110% | Broadest exposure; 3.65% div yield |
| URNM (Sprott) | Smaller | 34 companies | 0.75% | +93% | Purer-play; 11.6% physical uranium allocation |

**URA Top Holdings:** Cameco (23.2%), Oklo (11.6%), UEC (6.2%), NexGen (5.0%), Centrus (4.5%)

URNM provides more concentrated uranium exposure with its physical uranium allocation, while URA offers broader diversification including nuclear technology companies.

---

## 10. Key Investment Themes & Risks

### Bull Case
- **Structural deficit**: Primary supply covers ~75% of demand, secondary sources depleted
- **AI/data center demand**: New structural demand driver for nuclear baseload power
- **68+ reactors under construction**: Demand growth locked in for decades
- **Russian enrichment ban**: Forces Western fuel cycle reshoring, creating pricing power
- **Conversion bottleneck**: Tight capacity at 91% utilization with limited expansion options
- **Producer discipline**: Kazatomprom and Cameco holding back production
- **Inventory drawdown**: Utility stockpiles at multi-decade lows
- **$100+/lb consensus**: Industry projects sustained elevated pricing through at least 2028

### Bear Case / Risks
- **Policy reversal**: Waivers on Russian uranium imports could extend, easing supply pressure
- **Demand shock**: Reactor shutdowns or construction delays reduce requirements
- **Kazatomprom ramp**: Kazakhstan could return to 100% production levels rapidly if prices incentivize
- **Inventory releases**: Government or utility stockpile sales could temporarily depress prices
- **SMR delays**: If advanced reactors face longer timelines, HALEU demand gets pushed out
- **Substitution risk**: Renewables + storage displacing nuclear in some markets
- **Capital intensity**: Mine development requires $500M-2B+ and 7-15 year timelines

### Positioning Summary

| Segment | Top Picks | Thesis |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Large-cap producers | CCJ, KAP | Cash flow from rising contract prices; production discipline |
| Development-stage | NXE, DNN | Catalysts in 2026 (CNSC approvals); leverage to higher uranium prices |
| U.S. ISR producers | UEC, UUUU | Domestic supply premium; low capex restart optionality |
| Enrichment/HALEU | LEU | Only Western HALEU producer; $900M DOE contract; monopoly positioning |
| Physical exposure | SRUUF/U.UN | Direct commodity exposure; structural buying supports spot price |
| Diversified ETFs | URA, URNM | Broad or concentrated uranium sector exposure |
