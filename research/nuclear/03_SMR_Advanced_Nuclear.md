# Small Modular Reactors & Advanced Nuclear: Investment Research Report

**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Sector:** Energy / Nuclear Technology
**Theme:** SMRs, Advanced Fission, Fusion, Data Center Demand

---

## Executive Summary

The advanced nuclear sector is experiencing a historic inflection point driven by three converging forces: (1) insatiable data center power demand from AI infrastructure buildout, (2) the most pro-nuclear U.S. regulatory environment in decades via the ADVANCE Act and Executive Order 14300, and (3) over $6B in DOE funding commitments including ARDP awards, loan guarantees, and HALEU fuel availability programs. Big tech companies have signed 10+ GW of new U.S. nuclear capacity commitments in the past year alone. However, the sector remains pre-revenue for most pure-play companies, with first commercial SMR units not expected until 2029-2032 and significant execution risk around cost escalation, as demonstrated by the NuScale/UAMPS project cancellation in 2023.

---

## 1. Technology Landscape

### 1.1 Light-Water SMRs

**NuScale VOYGR** -- The only NRC-certified SMR design (Standard Design Approval, January 2023; uprated 250-MWt/77-MWe module approved May 2025). Pressurized water reactor using natural circulation, eliminating primary coolant pumps. Modules submerged in a common reactor pool. The UAMPS cancellation revealed that the pool infrastructure creates a large fixed cost regardless of module count, limiting the modularity advantage.

**GE Hitachi BWRX-300** -- 300 MWe boiling water reactor derived from the proven ESBWR design. Furthest along internationally: Ontario Power Generation received final construction permission in May 2025 for the first North American unit at Darlington, with commercial operation targeted by end of 2030. Additional commitments from Synthos Green Energy (10 units in Poland), SaskPower (Canada), Hunatom (Hungary), and Fortum (Finland/Sweden).

### 1.2 Molten Salt Reactors

**Kairos Power (Fluoride Salt-Cooled, HTGR)** -- Uses TRISO pebble fuel with molten fluoride salt coolant. Hermes test reactor (35 MWt) in Oak Ridge, TN received NRC construction permit in December 2023, the first non-light-water reactor construction permit in over 50 years. Safety-related concrete pour completed May 2025. Hermes 2 (two 35 MWt units) construction permit approved November 2024. Hermes targeted operational as early as 2026. Google signed a 500 MW corporate SMR fleet deal with Kairos, the first U.S. corporate SMR fleet agreement, with units coming online through 2035.

### 1.3 Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors

**TerraPower Natrium** -- 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with molten salt energy storage system boosting output to 500 MWe. Located in Kemmerer, Wyoming at a retired coal plant site. NRC completed final safety evaluation for construction permit in December 2025, one month ahead of schedule. Construction permit expected early 2026. Non-nuclear construction already underway. Commercial operation targeted 2030. Backed by Bill Gates, supported by over $2B in DOE cost-share funding.

**Oklo Aurora** -- Compact fast reactor using metallic fuel and heat pipes. Original NRC application denied in 2022; re-application underway with NRC accepting Principal Design Criteria topical report for accelerated review in 2025. Major deals announced: 1.2 GW agreement with Meta for southern Ohio deployment (pre-construction starting 2026, first phase online ~2030). DOE selected Oklo for medical radioisotope pilot facility and three fuel-fabrication facilities.

### 1.4 High-Temperature Gas Reactors (HTGR)

**X-energy Xe-100** -- 80 MWe HTGR using TRISO pebble fuel. First deployment planned at Dow Chemical's Seadrift, TX facility (four-pack, 320 MWe), replacing fossil generation. NRC application filed March 2025. TRISO-X fuel fabrication facility (TX-1) in Oak Ridge under construction, with regulatory approval anticipated by May 2026. Capacity: 700,000 TRISO fuel pebbles/year, enough for 11 Xe-100 units. Orderbook exceeds 11 GW (~144 reactors). Key customers: Amazon (5+ GW by 2039), Dow, Centrica (6 GW in UK).

### 1.5 Microreactors

**Project Pele (BWXT)** -- DOD mobile microreactor: 1.5+ MWe in a standard 20-foot shipping container, using TRISO fuel. BWXT began core manufacturing August 2025. First TRISO fuel delivered to Idaho National Laboratory December 2025. Assembly and testing at INL in 2026. Electricity production targeted 2028 per Executive Order 14299 (reactor at domestic military base by September 2028).

### Technology Comparison

| Developer | Type | Capacity | Fuel | Timeline | NRC Status |
|-----------|------|----------|------|----------|------------|
| NuScale VOYGR | Light-water PWR | 77 MWe/module | LEU | 2029-2032 | Certified (2023) |
| GE Hitachi BWRX-300 | Boiling water | 300 MWe | LEU | 2030 (Ontario) | Pre-application (US) |
| Kairos Power Hermes | Molten salt-cooled | 35 MWt (demo) | TRISO/HALEU | 2026 (demo) | Construction permit |

| Oklo Aurora | Fast reactor | 15-50 MWe | Metallic/HALEU | 2030+ | Re-application |
| X-energy Xe-100 | HTGR | 80 MWe | TRISO/HALEU | 2030+ | Application filed |
| BWXT Pele | Micro HTGR | 1.5+ MWe | TRISO | 2028 | DOD pathway |

---

## 2. NRC Licensing & Regulatory Environment

The regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically in favor of advanced nuclear:

**ADVANCE Act (2024)** -- Mandates NRC regulate in a manner that does not unnecessarily limit nuclear deployment. Key provisions:
- Reduced hourly rate for advanced reactor applicants: $148/hr (down from $318/hr, a 50%+ reduction)
- Binding licensing deadlines: 18 months max for new reactor applications, 12 months for renewals
- NRC has lowered project estimates by ~40% for schedules and ~35% for staff hours

**Executive Order 14300** -- Directs fundamental NRC reform with 24+ rulemakings, including a new licensing framework for microreactors (proposed rule March 2026). Front-loaded wave of proposed rules March-May 2026, final rules September-November 2026.

**Current Licensing Status:**
- NuScale: Only NRC-certified SMR design (SDA Jan 2023, uprate May 2025)
- Kairos: Construction permits for Hermes (Dec 2023) and Hermes 2 (Nov 2024)
- TerraPower: Final safety evaluation complete (Dec 2025), CP expected early 2026
- Oklo: Re-application in progress, accelerated review timeline
- X-energy: Application filed (March 2025)
- GE Hitachi: Pre-application in US; UK regulators advancing review

## 3. Cost Economics & UAMPS Lessons

### 3.1 The UAMPS Cautionary Tale

NuScale's Carbon Free Power Project with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems was cancelled in November 2023 after costs escalated dramatically:

- Target power price rose from $58/MWh (2021) to $89/MWh (53% increase)
- Estimated construction cost jumped from $5.3B to $9.3B (75% increase)
- Cost per kW reached ~$20,139/kW, comparable to the troubled Vogtle project
- UAMPS members lacked nuclear experience and could not absorb cost risk
- The design's large reactor pool created significant fixed costs regardless of module count

**Key Lessons:** First-of-a-kind (FOAK) cost premiums are real and severe. Customer selection matters -- municipal utilities with cheap gas/wind alternatives are poor first customers. The modularity thesis requires proving through actual nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) builds.

### 3.2 Current Cost Benchmarks

| Energy Source | LCOE ($/MWh) | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Utility solar | ~$30-35 | Unsubsidized, intermittent |
| Onshore wind | ~$37-45 | Unsubsidized, intermittent |
| Natural gas (CCGT) | $48-109 | Fuel price dependent |
| Solar + storage | $70-80 | 4-hour storage |
| Advanced nuclear/SMR | $95-110 | Estimated FOAK |
| Offshore wind | $85-120 | High capex |
| Rolls-Royce SMR target | <$81 | Aspirational NOAK |

**The bull case for SMR economics:** Nuclear provides firm, 24/7 baseload power regardless of weather -- a capability that solar and wind fundamentally cannot match without massive storage overbuild. Data centers require 99.999% uptime and growing gigawatt-scale loads, making nuclear's reliability premium increasingly valuable. As NOAK builds mature, industry targets LCOE below $80/MWh.

---

## 4. DOE Funding & HALEU Supply

### 4.1 Federal Funding Programs

- **ARDP (Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program):** Congress appropriated $230M initially; total DOE cost-share commitments exceed $6B across demonstration projects. TerraPower and X-energy are Pathway 1 awardees.
- **Loan Guarantees:** DOE Loan Programs Office has extended billions in conditional commitments to nuclear projects.
- **HALEU Availability Program:** DOE plans to make 21 metric tons of HALEU available by June 30, 2026. Five companies received conditional commitments: TRISO-X (X-energy), Kairos Power, Radiant Industries, Westinghouse, and TerraPower.

### 4.2 HALEU Production

Centrus Energy (LEU, NYSE) is the sole current domestic HALEU producer:
- Completed Phase II delivery of 900 kg HALEU to DOE by June 2025
- Phase III contract extension (~$110M) through June 2026, continuing at 900 kg/year
- $2.3B in contracts for future LEU enrichment capacity (first new capacity online ~2029)
- HALEU supply remains a critical bottleneck -- Russia was the primary global supplier before sanctions

## 5. Data Center Nuclear Demand

The AI infrastructure buildout has created an unprecedented demand signal for nuclear power:

| Company | Nuclear Deal | Capacity | Timeline |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Microsoft | Three Mile Island restart (Constellation) | 835 MW | 2028 |
| Microsoft | Helion fusion PPA | 50+ MW | 2028 |
| Google | Kairos Power SMR fleet | 500 MW | Through 2035 |
| Google | Westinghouse reactor buildout | 10 reactors | Construction from 2030 |
| Amazon | X-energy Xe-100 deployments | 5+ GW | By 2039 |
| Amazon | Dominion, Energy Northwest deals | 1.26 GW | Various |
| Oracle | SMR-powered data center | ~1 GW | Planning |
| Meta | Oklo partnership (Ohio) | 1.2 GW | First phase ~2030 |
| Meta | RFP for new nuclear generation | 1-4 GW | Early 2030s |
| Meta | Constellation Energy (existing IL plant) | Undisclosed | Near-term |

Big tech has signed over 10 GW of new U.S. nuclear capacity in the past year. These commitments provide crucial demand certainty for developers who previously struggled to find creditworthy offtakers.

| Commonwealth Fusion | ~$3B | $863M Series B2 (Aug 2025) | $5-6B est. | Nvidia, Google, Tiger Global |
| Helion Energy | $600M+ | Various | $3-5B est. | Sam Altman, Microsoft |
| TAE Technologies | $1.3B+ | $150M (Jun 2025) | ~$6B (merger) | Google, Chevron, TMTG merger |

X-energy's oversubscribed $700M Series D (led by Jane Street) and 11 GW orderbook make it arguably the most commercially advanced private SMR developer.

---

## 8. Fusion Energy

Fusion remains a longer-term bet but is attracting unprecedented capital:

**Commonwealth Fusion Systems** -- MIT spinout building SPARC tokamak using high-temperature superconducting magnets. SPARC operations scheduled to start 2026, with net power (Q > 1) targeted 2027. First ARC commercial power plant planned for Virginia. ~$3B raised total (~1/3 of all private fusion investment globally). Valuation estimated $5-6B.

**Helion Energy** -- Field-reversed configuration approach. Broke ground on Orion commercial plant (Chelan County, WA) in July 2025. Microsoft PPA for 50+ MW by end of 2028 -- the world's first fusion energy purchase agreement. Constellation Energy as power marketer. Backed by Sam Altman ($375M personal investment).

**TAE Technologies** -- Beam-driven field-reversed configuration. Achieved stable 70M+ degree C plasma in early 2025 breakthrough. Announced $6B merger with Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) in December 2025, expected to close mid-2026. TMTG providing up to $300M in funding. Aims for prototype commercial reactor by 2030.

**Investment thesis on fusion:** These are venture-style bets with binary outcomes. No fusion device has achieved sustained net energy gain for commercial power. Timelines have historically slipped by decades. However, the convergence of high-temperature superconductors (CFS), new plasma confinement approaches (Helion, TAE), and massive tech-sector capital means this cycle may be different. Position sizing should reflect the asymmetric risk/reward.

---

## 9. Key Risks

1. **Cost escalation** -- UAMPS showed FOAK SMR costs can double. No SMR has demonstrated competitive NOAK economics at scale.
2. **Timeline slippage** -- Nuclear projects have a long history of delays. Most commercial units are 4-8 years away.
3. **HALEU supply bottleneck** -- Domestic production at 900 kg/year is far below what fleet deployment requires. Russia sanctions compound the issue.
4. **NRC execution risk** -- Despite reforms, licensing timelines remain uncertain. Oklo's first application was denied.
5. **Technology risk** -- Most advanced designs (sodium, molten salt, HTGR) have never operated at commercial scale.
6. **Valuation risk** -- Oklo at $11B and NuScale at $5B are priced for flawless execution with zero revenue. Any setback could cause severe multiple compression.
7. **Political risk** -- Nuclear policy could shift with future administrations, though bipartisan support is currently strong.
8. **Competition from renewables + storage** -- Solar + battery costs continue declining and may erode nuclear's economic case for some applications.

---

## 10. Market Outlook & Sizing

- IEA projects global SMR investment rising from ~$5B today to $25B+ by 2030
- Cumulative SMR sector investment projected at $670B by 2050 (IEA)
- Conservative market estimates: $10-15B by 2030; optimistic: $40-50B by 2035
- COP28 pledge to triple global nuclear capacity by 2050 provides long-term policy tailwind
- 28+ countries expressed interest in SMR deployment at COP28
- U.S. leads with the most advanced regulatory framework and greatest number of designs in licensing

**Bottom line:** The advanced nuclear sector offers a rare combination of massive TAM, strong policy tailwinds, and unprecedented corporate demand. However, the gap between announced deals (mostly MOUs and letters of intent) and binding contracts with actual construction timelines remains wide. BWXT offers the lowest-risk exposure with proven revenue and profits. NuScale and Oklo offer higher-beta plays on the SMR buildout thesis but carry significant execution and valuation risk. X-energy (private) appears best-positioned among SMR developers given its fuel manufacturing advantage and 11 GW orderbook. Fusion investments should be sized as call options on transformative technology with 5-10+ year horizons.
