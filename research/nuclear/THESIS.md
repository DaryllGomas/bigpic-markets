# Nuclear Energy Investment Thesis

**February 2026 | BigPic Research**

---

## Executive Summary

Nuclear energy is experiencing a structural renaissance driven by three converging forces: (1) insatiable AI/data center demand for 24/7 carbon-free baseload power, (2) the strongest US policy environment in decades (ADVANCE Act, IRA credits, NRC reform), and (3) a global supply chain in deep deficit across uranium, conversion, enrichment, and HALEU fuel.

The Big 5 hyperscalers have contracted **10+ GW of nuclear capacity** in the past year, committing over **$50B in long-term PPAs** to nuclear fleet operators. Existing nuclear plants operating at ~$30/MWh are selling 20-year contracts at $80-120/MWh to Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google — a structural margin expansion that transforms historically volatile merchant generators into quasi-contracted infrastructure.

Simultaneously, the uranium market faces a **30-40M lb annual supply deficit** with spot prices above $100/lb, the nuclear fuel cycle's conversion and enrichment stages are capacity-constrained, and Western nations are racing to break dependency on Russia's 46% enrichment monopoly. Advanced reactor developers (SMRs, molten salt, sodium-cooled) have attracted unprecedented funding but remain 4-8 years from commercial deployment.

**Core thesis:** This is a multi-decade investment cycle spanning three layers — existing fleet operators (highest near-term visibility), fuel cycle companies (structural supply deficit), and next-gen technology developers (highest growth optionality but execution risk). Power availability is the binding constraint on AI infrastructure, and nuclear is the only scalable 24/7 carbon-free solution.

## Key Sectors

### 1. Nuclear Utilities & Fleet Operators

The existing US nuclear fleet is being repriced as irreplaceable infrastructure. No new large-scale nuclear plants can be built in the US within a decade (Vogtle took 14 years and $35B). The four publicly traded fleet operators — Constellation Energy, Vistra, Talen Energy, and PSEG — have locked in multi-decade contracts with the world's most creditworthy counterparties.

**Hyperscaler Nuclear Deals (Announced 2024-2026)**

| Hyperscaler | Partner | Plant/Technology | Capacity | Term | Est. Value |
|-------------|---------|------------------|----------|------|------------|
| Microsoft | Constellation | TMI Unit 1 (restart) | 835 MW | 20 yr | ~$16B |
| Meta | Constellation | Clinton (IL) | 1,121 MW | 20 yr | N/A |
| Meta | Vistra | Perry, Davis-Besse, Beaver Valley + 433MW uprates | 2,609 MW | 20 yr | N/A |
| Meta | Oklo | New build (Pike County, OH) | 1,200 MW | N/A | N/A |
| Meta | TerraPower | Natrium reactors | 690 MW initial, 2.8 GW total | N/A | N/A |
| Amazon | Talen | Susquehanna (PA) | 1,920 MW | 17 yr | ~$18B |
| Google | Kairos Power | SMR fleet | 500 MW | N/A | N/A |
| Undisclosed | Vistra | Comanche Peak (TX) | 1,200 MW | 20 yr | N/A |

**Fleet Expansion Catalysts:**
- NRC approving 80-year license extensions (Peach Bottom approved March 2025; 13 renewals in 2025)
- 6+ GW of capacity uprates under consideration (Meta-Vistra deal alone = 433 MW)
- Plant restarts: TMI Unit 1 (835 MW, target 2027-28), Palisades (800 MW, target early 2026)
- Executive Order directing 5 GW of uprates and 10 new large reactors by 2030

**Nuclear Plant Economics:**
- Operating cost: ~$30/MWh (merchant plants ~$28/MWh)
- Hyperscaler PPA rates: estimated $80-120/MWh
- Capacity factor: 93%+ (Constellation achieved 98.8% in Summer 2025)
- Fuel cost: ~15-20% of total operating cost
- Margin expansion: plants that were marginally economic at $25-35/MWh wholesale are now generating massive margins

### 2. Uranium Mining & Fuel Cycle

The uranium market is in a structural deficit unlikely to resolve before end of decade. Primary mine supply covers ~75% of global reactor requirements, secondary sources (inventories, underfeeding) are at historic lows, and every stage of the fuel cycle faces capacity constraints.

**Supply-Demand Fundamentals:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Uranium spot price (Jan 2026 peak) | ~$100/lb U3O8 |
| Long-term contract price | $75-85/lb (Cameco targeting $130-140 ceilings) |
| Annual reactor demand | ~179M lbs U3O8 |
| Annual mine production | ~140-150M lbs |
| Annual supply gap | ~30-40M lbs |
| By 2035, mines cover | Only 40% of demand |

**Conversion Bottleneck:**
Only 4 major Western conversion facilities operating at ~91% utilization. Buffer inventories depleted. 5.5-7.7% CAGR in requirements through 2040.

**Enrichment Geopolitics:**
Russia controls ~46% of global enrichment capacity (27M SWU/yr). US ban on Russian enriched uranium effective 2028. Western expansion: Urenco adding 2.5M SWU globally, Centrus awarded $900M for commercial-scale HALEU. Gap will take 5-7 years to fully close.

**Key Producers:**

| Company | Ticker | Production (2025-26) | Key Catalyst |
|---------|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Kazatomprom | KAP | 27.5-29K tU (2026, ~10% below capacity) | Production discipline = price support |
| Cameco | CCJ | Up to 20M lbs (McArthur cuts tighten supply) | Rising contract prices (+5-10% in 2026) |
| NexGen Energy | NXE | Development (30M lbs/yr capacity) | CNSC hearing Feb 2026 |
| Denison Mines | DNN | Construction-ready Q1 2026 | First Athabasca ISR mine |
| Uranium Energy Corp | UEC | Ramping ISR production | Burke Hollow + Christensen Ranch |
| Energy Fuels | UUUU | >1M lbs (2025) + rare earth pivot | Dual uranium/REE play |
| Centrus Energy | LEU | 900 kg/yr HALEU (pilot) | $900M DOE commercial expansion |

### 3. SMRs & Advanced Nuclear Technology

The advanced nuclear sector is at a historic inflection point. Big tech has signed 10+ GW of commitments. The ADVANCE Act cut NRC fees 50%+ for advanced reactors. DOE has committed $6B+ in funding. However, most pure-play companies remain pre-revenue with first commercial units 4-8 years away.

**Technology Status:**

| Developer | Type | Capacity | Timeline | NRC Status | Key Backer |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|------------|------------|
| NuScale VOYGR | Light-water PWR | 77 MWe/module | 2029-2032 | Certified (2023) | TVA/ENTRA1 (6 GW MOU) |
| GE Hitachi BWRX-300 | Boiling water | 300 MWe | 2030 (Ontario) | Pre-application (US) | OPG, Synthos, SaskPower |
| Kairos Power Hermes | Molten salt-cooled | 35 MWt (demo) | 2026 (demo) | Construction permit | Google (500 MW) |
| TerraPower Natrium | Sodium-cooled fast | 345-500 MWe | 2030 | CP expected Q1 2026 | Bill Gates, DOE |
| Oklo Aurora | Fast reactor | 15-50 MWe | 2030+ | Re-application | Sam Altman, Meta (1.2 GW) |
| X-energy Xe-100 | HTGR | 80 MWe | 2030+ | Application filed | Amazon (5+ GW), Dow |
| BWXT Pele | Micro HTGR | 1.5+ MWe | 2028 | DOD pathway | US military |

**UAMPS Cautionary Tale:** NuScale's first project cancelled in 2023 after costs jumped from $5.3B to $9.3B (+75%). FOAK cost premiums are real — current SMR LCOE estimates of $95-110/MWh must prove through actual builds.

**Fusion (Venture-Stage):**
- Commonwealth Fusion Systems: ~$3B raised, SPARC operational 2026, net power target 2027
- Helion Energy: Microsoft PPA for 50+ MW by 2028, Sam Altman backing
- TAE Technologies: $6B TMTG merger announced Dec 2025

### 4. Policy & Regulatory Environment

**US Policy Stack:**
- **ADVANCE Act (2024):** NRC fees cut 50%+, 18-month licensing deadlines, foreign ownership liberalization
- **IRA Credits:** Section 45U (1.5¢/kWh for existing plants through 2032), Section 45X (manufacturing)
- **Executive Order 14300:** Comprehensive NRC reform with binding deadlines, Part 53 framework for advanced reactors (final rule March 2026)
- **DOE Loan Programs:** Nuclear is "by far the biggest use" — Palisades ($1.52B), TMI ($1B), FY2026 requesting $30B in new Title 17 authority
- **Russian Uranium Ban:** Effective 2028, unlocked $2.72B for domestic enrichment investment

**Global Buildout:**

| Country | Program | Scale | Timeline |
|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| China | Hualong One batch production | 150+ reactors to 200 GW by 2035 | 10 approved April 2025 (~$27.5B) |
| UK | Sizewell C (EPR) | 2 units, GBP 38B (~$51B) | FID signed July 2025 |
| France | EPR2 revival | 6 reactors + SMR pipeline | EUR 50B program |
| India | Nuclear Energy Mission | 100 GW by 2047 | From 8.2 GW today |
| South Korea | APR-1400 exports | Barakah success = marketing credential | Czech tender pursuit |
| Saudi Arabia | Civil nuclear | 2 reactors + domestic enrichment | US cooperation framework signed Nov 2025 |

**Key Risk: NRC Staffing.** ~195 employees departed since Jan 2025, including 11 senior managers. Federal hiring freeze compounds the problem. The NRC faces its most ambitious workload in decades with a shrinking workforce — this is arguably the single biggest near-term bottleneck for US nuclear deployment.

## Risk Factors

### High Impact

1. **Construction cost escalation** — Vogtle ($14B → $35B) and UAMPS ($5.3B → $9.3B cancelled) demonstrate that nuclear cost overruns are the norm, not the exception. FOAK premiums are severe.

2. **NRC staffing crisis** — ~195 departures since Jan 2025 with a hiring freeze. The agency faces the most ambitious reform agenda in decades with a shrinking workforce. Licensing delays could cascade through the entire sector.

3. **HALEU supply gap** — Current Western production: 900 kg/yr (Centrus pilot). Advanced reactors need orders of magnitude more. Commercial scale not expected until 2029+. Russia was the sole commercial source before sanctions.

4. **Valuation risk in pre-revenue names** — Oklo at $11B and NuScale at $5B with zero/minimal revenue. Any execution setback could cause severe multiple compression.

### Medium Impact

5. **Hyperscaler demand moderation** — If AI capex slows or energy efficiency improves faster than expected, power demand growth could underperform projections.

6. **Electricity price normalization** — If wholesale power prices decline, merchant nuclear margins compress (though 20-year PPAs mitigate for contracted fleet).

7. **Uranium price volatility** — Kazatomprom could return to 100% production levels, government stockpile releases could temporarily depress spot prices.

8. **Russian enrichment waivers extended** — Policy reversals on the uranium import ban could ease supply pressure on Western enrichment capacity.

9. **SMR timeline slippage** — Most commercial SMR units are 4-8 years away. Advanced reactor designs (sodium, molten salt, HTGR) have never operated at commercial scale.

### Structural / Long-Term

10. **Nuclear waste policy** — 90,000 metric tons of spent fuel stored at reactor sites with no permanent disposal pathway. Yucca Mountain remains stalled. Interim storage facilities cleared by Supreme Court but face local opposition.

11. **Competition from renewables + storage** — Solar + battery costs continue declining. For some applications, renewables may erode nuclear's economic case (though 24/7 firm power requirements increasingly favor nuclear).

12. **Geopolitical fuel supply risk** — Russia + China could leverage nuclear fuel supply chains as strategic weapons. Western decoupling is underway but will take 5-7+ years.

## Recommended Watchlist

### Tier 1 — Highest Conviction (Core Positions)

| Ticker | Company | Thesis |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **CEG** | Constellation Energy | Largest nuclear fleet globally (22.6 GW), most hyperscaler relationships, Calpine acquisition creates 55 GW clean energy giant. Premium valuation justified by asset irreplaceability. |
| **VST** | Vistra Corp | Best value in fleet operators at ~14-16x fwd P/E with ~73-93% earnings growth in 2026. Meta deal provides 20-year revenue visibility. |
| **CCJ** | Cameco | Blue-chip uranium exposure, rising contract prices, production discipline. Safest way to play uranium supply deficit. |
| **LEU** | Centrus Energy | Only Western HALEU producer. $900M DOE expansion contract. Monopoly positioning in a strategically critical supply chain. |

### Tier 2 — High Conviction (Growth Positions)

| Ticker | Company | Thesis |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **TLN** | Talen Energy | $18B Amazon contract provides extraordinary revenue visibility. Single-asset risk but Strong Buy consensus. |
| **BWXT** | BWX Technologies | De-risked advanced nuclear play — $6B backlog, Navy reactor monopoly, profitable. Only way to play nuclear with real earnings. |
| **NXE** | NexGen Energy | Largest development-stage uranium project (30M lbs/yr). CNSC hearing Feb 2026 = near-term catalyst. |
| **UEC** | Uranium Energy Corp | Largest US-focused uranium producer, ISR ramp providing operating leverage to price. |
| **UUUU** | Energy Fuels | Dual uranium/rare earth optionality. Only operating US conventional uranium mill. |

### Tier 3 — Speculative / Watchlist

| Ticker | Company | Thesis |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **DNN** | Denison Mines | Wheeler River ISR, construction-ready Q1 2026, $700M+ war chest. High leverage to uranium price. |
| **OKLO** | Oklo | 1.2 GW Meta deal, fuel recycling IP, Sam Altman backing. Pre-revenue, $11B valuation = high risk. |
| **SMR** | NuScale Power | Only NRC-certified SMR. 6 GW TVA MOU. But UAMPS failure and pre-revenue status warrant caution. |
| **PEG** | PSEG | 3.6 GW fleet exploring hyperscaler deals. Regulated utility = lower volatility but less upside. |
| **SRUUF** | Sprott Uranium Trust | Direct physical uranium exposure. At-the-market buying supports spot price structurally. |
| **URA** | Global X Uranium ETF | Broadest uranium sector exposure for investors wanting diversified basket approach. |

### Avoid / Wait

| Ticker | Company | Reason |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Private: X-energy | — | Best-positioned private SMR developer (11 GW orderbook, $700M Series D) but no public equity access. Watch for IPO. |
| Private: Kairos Power | — | Google-backed, fastest demo progress. Wait for public listing. |
| Private: TerraPower | — | Bill Gates-backed, Natrium construction imminent. No equity access. |
| Fusion companies | CFS, Helion, TAE | Venture-stage bets. Binary outcomes, 5-10+ year timelines. Size as call options only. |
