# Nuclear Utilities & Fleet Operators: Investment Research Report

*Date: February 7, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Nuclear energy is experiencing a structural renaissance driven by hyperscaler demand for 24/7 carbon-free power, favorable regulatory tailwinds, and tightening electricity supply. The three dominant publicly traded nuclear fleet operators -- Constellation Energy (CEG), Vistra (VST), and Talen Energy (TLN) -- have signed over $50 billion in long-term power purchase agreements with Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon since 2024. Existing nuclear plants, with industry-leading ~93% capacity factors and operating costs around $30/MWh, are being revalued as irreplaceable baseload assets. NRC life extensions to 80 years, capacity uprates, and plant restarts (Three Mile Island, Palisades) are expanding output from the existing fleet without new construction timelines or cost overruns.

## The Nuclear Fleet Landscape

### U.S. Nuclear Capacity Overview

The U.S. operates 93 commercial nuclear reactors at 54 sites, generating approximately 20% of the nation's electricity. Nuclear remains the single largest source of carbon-free electricity in the country. The fleet achieved a record average capacity factor of 93.5% in recent years, far exceeding any other generation source.

## Company Deep Dives

### Constellation Energy (CEG) -- The Nuclear Titan

Constellation is the world's largest operator of nuclear power plants and the dominant name in the nuclear renaissance trade. Its 21-reactor, 22.6 GW nuclear fleet is unmatched globally among publicly traded companies.

**Key Financial Metrics:**
- Market cap: ~$90B (as of Feb 2026, down from peak of ~$130B)
- Stock price: ~$247 (52-week range: $161-$413)
- 2025E adjusted operating EPS: $9.05-$9.45 (standalone)
- 2026E EPS (consensus): ~$11.28 (21% YoY growth)
- Forward P/E: ~31x
- 2024 EBITDA: $7.05B
- 2025E standalone EBITDA: $5.2B-$5.6B
- Capital allocation: 10% annual dividend growth target, $600M remaining buyback
- Post-Calpine liquidity: ~$14B

**Calpine Acquisition (Closed Jan 7, 2026):**
Constellation acquired Calpine in a $26.6B transaction (equity value ~$16.4B: 50M shares + $4.5B cash, plus $12.7B assumed net debt). Acquisition multiple: 7.9x 2026E EV/EBITDA. This deal adds approximately 27 GW of predominantly natural gas generation, creating a 55 GW combined fleet. Expected to deliver 20%+ EPS accretion in 2026 and over $2B in annual free cash flow. The deal diversifies Constellation beyond nuclear while strengthening its competitive moat as the nation's largest electricity producer.

**Nuclear-Specific Catalysts:**
- Three Mile Island Unit 1 restart (835 MW) via 20-year Microsoft PPA; $1.6B investment, DOE $1B loan closed Nov 2025; target restart 2027-2028
- Clinton Clean Energy Center 20-year PPA with Meta (1,121 MW); begins June 2027; includes 30 MW uprate
- South Texas Project 44% stake acquired from NRG for $1.65B, adding 1,100 MW
- NRC renewed licenses for Clinton and Dresden in Dec 2025; Constellation investing $370M in upgrades
- Exploring advanced nuclear/SMR development at Clinton site

**Bull Case:** Constellation has the largest nuclear fleet, the most hyperscaler relationships, and the Calpine acquisition creates a diversified clean energy giant. Nuclear fleet generates predictable, high-margin cash flow with 20-year PPA visibility.

**Bear Case:** Forward P/E of ~31x is expensive for a utility. Stock has pulled back ~40% from its $413 peak. Calpine integration risk. TMI restart faces execution uncertainty and could be delayed beyond 2028.

---

### Vistra Corp (VST) -- The Diversified Nuclear Play

Vistra is an integrated retail electricity provider and power generator that acquired Energy Harbor's nuclear fleet (Davis-Besse, Perry, Beaver Valley) for $3.4B. Combined with Comanche Peak in Texas, Vistra operates ~6.4 GW of nuclear capacity.

**Key Financial Metrics:**
- Market cap: ~$50B
- Stock price: ~$158 (52-week range varies)
- Trailing P/E: ~56x (reflects transition year)
- Forward P/E: ~14-16x
- 2025E net income: $1.74B-$1.89B
- 2026E net income: $3.01B-$3.64B (73-93% YoY growth)
- 77% stock return over the past year

**Key Deals:**
- **Comanche Peak PPA (Sept 2025):** 20-year agreement to supply 1,200 MW of carbon-free electricity; delivery begins Q4 2027, full capacity by 2032; option for 20-year extension
- **Meta Deal (Jan 2026):** 20-year PPAs covering 2,609 MW from Perry, Davis-Besse, and Beaver Valley, including 433 MW of uprates -- the largest nuclear uprates ever backed by a corporate customer. Deliveries begin late 2026, full capacity by 2034.
- Acquired seven natural gas generation facilities totaling ~2,600 MW across PJM, New England, New York, and California in Oct 2025

**Bull Case:** Forward P/E of ~14-16x is far cheaper than CEG. Massive earnings ramp from $1.8B to $3.3B+ in 2026. Nuclear fleet is now fully contracted under long-term PPAs with creditworthy hyperscaler counterparties. The 433 MW uprate program is funded by Meta.

**Bear Case:** Nuclear fleet is smaller than Constellation's. More gas-heavy generation mix. Comanche Peak sits in ERCOT (Texas), which has different pricing dynamics than PJM.

### Talen Energy (TLN) -- The Susquehanna Pure Play

Talen Energy emerged from bankruptcy in 2023 and has been transformed by the AI data center boom. Its 2.5 GW Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania is now the centerpiece of an $18B relationship with Amazon.

**Key Financial Metrics:**
- Market cap: ~$15B
- Stock price: ~$325 (52-week range: $158-$451)
- Analyst consensus: Strong Buy (15 Buy, 0 Sell)
- Average 12-month price target: ~$473

**Amazon-Susquehanna Deal:**
Originally structured as a behind-the-meter (BTM) co-location deal, FERC rejected the arrangement twice. Talen and Amazon restructured into a front-of-the-meter (FTM) retail model:
- 17-year PPA worth ~$18B in total revenue
- Up to 1,920 MW from Susquehanna's 2.5 GW output
- Talen serves as AWS's licensed retail electricity provider in Pennsylvania
- Delivery ramp: 840-1,200 MW by 2029, 1,680-1,920 MW by 2032
- Transition from BTM to FTM expected Spring 2026 during refueling outage
- Exploring SMR development within Talen's Pennsylvania footprint
- Pursuing Susquehanna output uprates to add net-new energy to PJM grid

**Bull Case:** $18B contracted revenue from Amazon provides extraordinary revenue visibility. Strong Buy consensus. If Susquehanna uprates succeed, incremental capacity goes straight to Amazon at premium rates.

**Bear Case:** Single-asset concentration risk (one nuclear plant). Smaller and less diversified than CEG or VST. Stock has already more than doubled from 2025 lows.

---

### PSEG (PEG) -- The Regulated Nuclear Operator

PSEG operates the Salem-Hope Creek complex in New Jersey, the fourth-largest nuclear facility in the U.S. at 3,572 MW combined. PSEG owns 100% of Hope Creek (1,173 MW) and 57% of Salem. The remaining 43% of Salem is owned by Constellation.

**Key Details:**
- Market cap: ~$40B
- Stock price: ~$80
- Generates ~40% of New Jersey's electricity
- Exploring selling nuclear power directly to data centers
- Filed for subsequent license renewal (80-year operation)

PSEG operates as a regulated utility, providing lower volatility but also less upside from merchant nuclear repricing. The company is actively exploring hyperscaler partnerships but has not yet announced a major deal comparable to CEG, VST, or TLN.

## Nuclear Plant Economics

### Operating Cost Advantage

Nuclear power's operating economics are compelling for existing plants. The fixed cost structure means that once built, nuclear plants produce the cheapest baseload electricity in the U.S.:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average total generating cost (2023) | $31.76/MWh |
| Merchant plant average cost | $28.11/MWh |
| Regulated plant average cost | $34.56/MWh |
| Average capacity factor (2024) | ~93% |
| Constellation nuclear capacity factor (Summer 2025) | 98.8% |
| Fuel cost share | ~15-20% of total cost |
| LCOE for new advanced nuclear (EIA) | ~$110/MWh |

The ~$30/MWh operating cost for existing nuclear is far below current wholesale power prices in PJM ($50-80/MWh range) and dramatically below the rates hyperscalers are willing to pay in 20-year PPAs. This spread is the core of the nuclear investment thesis: plants that were marginally economic at $25-35/MWh wholesale prices in 2020 are now generating massive margins at current prices.

### Merchant vs. Regulated Economics

Merchant nuclear plants in deregulated markets (PJM, ERCOT, ISO-NE) capture the full upside of rising wholesale electricity prices and premium hyperscaler PPAs. Regulated nuclear plants receive guaranteed cost recovery but miss the upside. The appropriate risk discount rate for regulated plants is ~5% versus ~10% for merchant plants, reflecting the different risk profiles.

**Key dynamic:** Carbon mitigation credit (ZEC/CMC) programs in states like Illinois and New York originally supported struggling nuclear plants with ~$10-17/MWh subsidies. With elevated wholesale prices, these programs are now returning net credits to ratepayers -- essentially, nuclear plants no longer need subsidies to be profitable, and the ZEC programs are being replaced by long-term corporate PPAs (as in the Constellation-Meta/Clinton deal).

---

## Hyperscaler Nuclear Demand

### The AI Power Crunch

Global data center electricity demand is projected to more than double from 460 TWh in 2024 to over 1,000 TWh by 2030. In the U.S. alone, data center consumption is expected to grow from 183 TWh (2024) to 426 TWh by 2030, a 133% increase. Nuclear currently supplies approximately 20% of U.S. data center electricity.

### Major Hyperscaler Nuclear Deals

| Hyperscaler | Partner | Plant/Technology | Capacity | Term | Value | Status |
|------------|---------|-----------------|----------|------|-------|--------|
| Microsoft | Constellation | Three Mile Island Unit 1 (restart) | 835 MW | 20 yr | ~$16B est. | Restart target 2027-28 |
| Meta | Constellation | Clinton (IL) | 1,121 MW | 20 yr | N/A | Begins June 2027 |
| Meta | Vistra | Perry, Davis-Besse, Beaver Valley + uprates | 2,609 MW | 20 yr | N/A | Begins late 2026 |
| Meta | Oklo | New build (Pike County, OH) | 1,200 MW | N/A | N/A | First phase ~2030 |
| Meta | TerraPower | Natrium reactors (new build) | 690 MW initial, up to 2.8 GW | N/A | N/A | Delivery ~2032-35 |
| Amazon | Talen | Susquehanna (PA) | 1,920 MW | 17 yr | ~$18B | Ramp 2026-32 |
| Google | Kairos Power/TVA | Hermes 2 SMR (new build) | 500 MW | N/A | N/A | First reactor ~2030 |
| Undisclosed | Vistra | Comanche Peak (TX) | 1,200 MW | 20 yr | N/A | Delivery Q4 2027 |

**Total contracted nuclear for hyperscalers: 10+ GW and growing**

### Contract Structures

Three primary models have emerged:

1. **Front-of-the-Meter PPA (dominant model):** Generator sells power into the grid; buyer purchases via a long-term fixed-price or indexed PPA. Used in the Talen-Amazon restructured deal, Vistra-Meta deal, and Constellation-Meta deal. Avoids FERC co-location regulatory issues.

2. **Behind-the-Meter / Co-location:** Data center physically co-located at the plant site, drawing power directly. FERC rejected the original Talen-Amazon co-location arrangement twice, making this model legally uncertain for nuclear.

3. **Contract for Difference (CFD):** Buyer and generator agree on a strike price; if wholesale prices fall below, buyer pays the difference; if above, generator pays back. Provides revenue certainty for both parties. Used in some European nuclear contracts and state ZEC/CMC programs.

Specific $/MWh pricing for hyperscaler nuclear PPAs is not publicly disclosed, but industry estimates suggest premium rates of $80-120/MWh for 24/7 carbon-free power, well above the ~$30/MWh operating cost for existing plants.

## Fleet Expansion: Life Extensions, Uprates, and Restarts

### 80-Year License Extensions (Subsequent License Renewal)

The NRC has approved subsequent license renewals (SLR) extending reactor operations from 60 to 80 years. Only four reactors have received SLR approval so far:
- **Turkey Point-3 and -4** (Florida Power & Light) -- first approvals
- **Peach Bottom-2 and -3** (Exelon/Constellation, PA) -- approved March 5, 2025

In 2025, the NRC approved 13 reactor license renewals totaling 12,000 MW. Additional SLR applications are in the pipeline, including PSEG's Hope Creek and Salem plants. NRC review timelines are improving from 22-30 months toward a target of 18 months.

### Power Uprates

Over the past 20 years, the NRC has approved uprates adding 6 GW to the U.S. nuclear fleet. An additional 2+ GW of uprates is under consideration. The DOE executive order directs prioritizing 5 GW of uprates to existing reactors. The Meta-Vistra deal alone includes 433 MW of uprates across three plants -- the largest corporate-backed nuclear uprate program ever.

### Plant Restarts

| Plant | Operator | Capacity | Status | Timeline |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| Three Mile Island Unit 1 | Constellation | 835 MW | DOE $1B loan closed; $1.6B total investment | Target 2027-28 |
| Palisades | Holtec International | 800 MW | Rehabilitation and testing ongoing | Delayed to Feb-Mar 2026 |

Palisades would be the first U.S. nuclear plant to restart after entering decommissioning. TMI Unit 1 operated safely for decades before economic shutdown in 2019 and is being renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. Both restarts would add ~1,635 MW of carbon-free baseload to the grid.

## Valuation & Investment Considerations

### Comparative Valuation

| Metric | CEG | VST | TLN | PEG |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Market Cap | ~$90B | ~$50B | ~$15B | ~$40B |
| Forward P/E | ~31x | ~14-16x | N/A | N/A |
| 2026E EPS Growth | ~21% | ~73-93% | N/A | N/A |
| Nuclear Capacity | 22.6 GW | 6.4 GW | 2.5 GW | 3.6 GW |
| Enterprise Value / Nuclear GW | ~$4.0B/GW | ~$7.8B/GW | ~$6.0B/GW | ~$11.1B/GW |
| Contracted Hyperscaler Revenue | TMI (MSFT), Clinton (Meta), STP | Comanche Peak, Perry/Davis-Besse/BV (Meta) | Susquehanna (Amazon, $18B) | Exploring |
| Analyst Consensus | Buy | Buy | Strong Buy | Hold/Buy |

### Key Investment Themes

**1. Nuclear as an Irreplaceable Asset Class:** No new large-scale nuclear plants can be built in the U.S. within the next decade (Vogtle Units 3 & 4, completed 2023-24, took 14 years and $35B). Existing plants are essentially non-replicable infrastructure, and their value is being repriced accordingly.

**2. PPA Revenue Visibility:** The nuclear fleet operators have locked in 17-20 year contracts with the most creditworthy counterparties in the world (Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Google). This transforms historically volatile merchant generators into quasi-contracted infrastructure.

**3. Capacity Factor Advantage:** At 93%+ average capacity factor, nuclear is the most reliable power source on the grid. This matters for data centers that require 99.999% uptime and cannot tolerate intermittency.

**4. Upside Optionality:** Capacity uprates (433 MW from Vistra's Meta deal alone), plant restarts (TMI, Palisades), and 80-year license extensions all provide incremental growth without new-build risk.

**5. Policy Tailwinds:** Executive orders directing 5 GW of uprates and 10 new large reactors under construction by 2030, combined with streamlined NRC processes, create a favorable regulatory environment.

### Risks

- **Execution risk on restarts:** TMI and Palisades face engineering and regulatory uncertainty
- **Valuation compression:** CEG trades at 31x forward earnings after pulling back 40% from highs
- **Electricity price normalization:** If wholesale power prices decline, merchant nuclear margins compress (though long-term PPAs mitigate this)
- **Regulatory risk:** FERC and NRC decisions can materially impact deal structures (as seen with the Talen-Amazon BTM rejection)
- **Hyperscaler demand moderation:** If AI capex slows, data center power demand growth could underperform projections
- **Nuclear-specific risks:** Unplanned outages, NRC enforcement actions, waste disposal policy changes

---

## Conclusion

The nuclear utility sector has transformed from a struggling, subsidy-dependent industry into the most sought-after power source for the world's largest technology companies. Constellation, Vistra, and Talen have collectively contracted over $50B in long-term nuclear PPAs since 2024. With operating costs around $30/MWh against hyperscaler willingness to pay $80-120/MWh for 24/7 clean power, existing nuclear fleet margins are structurally expanding.

Among the three primary plays, Vistra (VST) offers the most attractive valuation at ~14-16x forward P/E with 73-93% earnings growth in 2026, backed by the massive Meta deal. Constellation (CEG) is the category leader with the largest fleet and most diversified hyperscaler relationships but trades at a premium. Talen (TLN) provides the most concentrated nuclear exposure through its $18B Amazon contract but carries single-asset risk.

The structural thesis -- AI-driven power demand meeting a supply-constrained nuclear fleet with 80-year operating lives -- remains intact regardless of near-term stock price volatility.
