# Nuclear Energy: Policy, Regulation & Geopolitical Dynamics

*Investment Research Report | February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Nuclear energy is experiencing its strongest policy tailwinds in decades. In the US, the bipartisan ADVANCE Act (signed July 2024), IRA tax credits, and aggressive NRC reform via Executive Order 14300 have created a multi-layered incentive framework for new deployment. Globally, China is building half the world's new reactors, the UK committed over GBP 38 billion to Sizewell C, and France is rebooting with its EPR2 program. The critical bottleneck remains fuel supply: Russia still controls approximately 46% of global enrichment capacity and holds a near-monopoly on HALEU, though the US is investing billions to stand up domestic alternatives. Investors should monitor NRC staffing risks, construction cost discipline (Vogtle's $35B+ lessons loom large), and the timeline for HALEU supply independence as key variables in nuclear's investment thesis.

## US Federal Policy Framework

### The ADVANCE Act (July 2024)

The Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support (393-13 in the House, 88-2 in the Senate) and was signed by President Biden on July 9, 2024. Key provisions:

- **NRC Mission Update**: Requires the NRC to revise its mission statement within one year to include that licensing and regulation should not "unnecessarily limit" the benefits of nuclear energy deployment.
- **Reduced Regulatory Fees**: Advanced reactor applicants pay a reduced hourly rate (~$160/hour vs. prior rates) covering only direct salary and benefits costs, effective October 1, 2025.
- **First-Mover Fee Rebates**: The first applicant to receive an operating license in each of five reactor categories gets regulatory fees reimbursed, incentivizing early movers.
- **Foreign Investment Liberalization**: Removes foreign ownership restrictions for entities from OECD nations and India, opening the door to majority ownership by investors from South Korea, Japan, the UK, France, Canada, and others.
- **Export Streamlining**: Tasks DOE with improving the technology export approval process while maintaining nonproliferation standards.

### IRA Nuclear Tax Credits

The Inflation Reduction Act established multiple credit mechanisms:

- **Section 45U (Existing Plants)**: Zero-emission nuclear power production credit of up to 1.5 cents/kWh (with prevailing wage multiplier) for existing facilities, available for electricity produced and sold from 2024 through 2032. This credit has been critical for keeping economically marginal existing plants online.
- **Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing)**: Production tax credits for manufacturing of nuclear-relevant components including inverter equipment and electricity storage equipment.
- **Tech-Neutral Transition**: Sections 45Y and 48E tech-neutral credits began January 1, 2025, though nuclear-specific 45J and 45U credits remain available concurrently through 2025.

### DOE Loan Programs Office

The DOE Loan Programs Office (now reorganized under the Office of Energy Dominance Financing) has become the primary federal financing vehicle for nuclear projects. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has stated that nuclear power plants will be "by far the biggest use" of LPO dollars.

Key financings include:
- **Palisades Restart**: Up to $1.52 billion in loan guarantees (approximately $57 million disbursed as of early 2025) for the first-ever major US nuclear plant reactivation in Michigan.
- **Pennsylvania Nuclear Restart**: Loan closed in November 2025 for a second plant restart.
- **FY2026 Budget**: Requests $750 million in credit subsidy and $30 billion in new Title 17 loan authority, primarily targeting nuclear, critical minerals, and grid infrastructure.

## NRC Reform and Licensing Modernization

### Executive Order 14300 (May 2025)

President Trump's EO 14300 mandates comprehensive NRC restructuring with binding deadlines:

- **18-month licensing decisions** for new reactor applications (down from historical timelines of 3-5+ years).
- **12-month license renewals** for existing plants.
- **9-month deadline** (February 2026) for NRC to issue proposed rulemakings for the regulatory overhaul.
- **18-month deadline** (November 2026) for final rules and guidance.

### Part 53 Framework

The technology-inclusive, risk-informed, performance-based licensing framework under 10 CFR Part 53 -- mandated by the 2019 Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA) -- is scheduled for final rule publication on March 27, 2026. This framework is designed to accommodate advanced reactor designs (SMRs, molten salt, high-temperature gas) that do not fit the legacy light-water reactor regulatory model.

### NRC Staffing Risk

The NRC faces a significant workforce challenge that directly threatens the reform timeline:

- In FY2023, the agency hired only 281 of its 400-person hiring target, finishing roughly 160 positions short.
- Since January 2025, approximately 195 employees have departed, including 11 senior managers, 143 who left between January and June, and over 100 who accepted deferred resignation offers.
- The federal hiring freeze compounds the problem as the agency simultaneously faces its most ambitious licensing workload in decades.
- A GAO review found the NRC lacks benchmarks to assess whether its recruitment strategies are effective.

**Investment Implication**: NRC staffing is arguably the single biggest near-term bottleneck for US nuclear deployment. Even with favorable policy, insufficient reviewer capacity could delay licensing timelines and create a gap between policy ambition and execution.

## Global Nuclear Buildout

### China: Dominant Scale

China is building approximately half the world's new nuclear capacity and is on track to surpass France as the world's second-largest nuclear power producer in 2026:

- **Operating capacity**: ~62 GWe as of end-2025, with 59 operational plants.
- **Under construction**: ~43 GWe additional capacity in the pipeline.
- **April 2025 approval**: 10 new reactors (8 Hualong One, 2 CAP1000) across five projects totaling over 200 billion yuan (~$27.5 billion), with commercial operation targeted for 2030-2031.
- **Hualong One scale-up**: 41 units now in operation or under construction, entering batch-scale production.
- **SMR development**: The Linglong One SMR is scheduled for completion by 2026.
- **Long-term target**: 200 GW by 2035, requiring approximately 150 additional reactors; 400-500 GW by 2050.

### United Kingdom: Sizewell C Commitment

On July 22, 2025, the UK signed the Final Investment Decision for Sizewell C, a two-unit EPR project valued at over GBP 38 billion (~$51 billion). The financing package includes GBP 5 billion in French export credit financing (BpifranceAE) and debt financing from the UK's National Wealth Fund. This represents the largest single UK energy infrastructure commitment in decades.

### France: EPR2 Revival

President Macron's approximately EUR 50 billion nuclear revival strategy centers on six next-generation EPR2 reactors plus a pipeline of SMRs. The program is explicitly designed to rebuild France's nuclear industrial base, perpetuate workforce skills, and generate economies of scale.

### South Korea: Export Champion

South Korea's KHNP delivered the four-unit Barakah plant in the UAE ahead of schedule and within budget -- a rare achievement in the global nuclear industry and a powerful marketing credential. The APR-1400 is increasingly positioned as the default Western-aligned option for first-time nuclear countries, with active pursuit of the Czech Republic tender and other opportunities.

### India: Nuclear Energy Mission

India announced plans in February 2025 to develop at least 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047 as part of its energy transition. Near-term targets include growing from 8,180 MW (January 2025) to 22,480 MW by 2031-2032. India signed an SMR letter of intent with France and is advancing the US-India 123 Civil Nuclear Agreement for US-designed reactors. Federal funds target at least five Indian-designed SMRs operational by 2033, with legislative amendments to enable private sector participation.

### Saudi Arabia: Early-Stage Entrant

Saudi Arabia is pursuing two civil power reactors (scaled back from 16 originally proposed in 2013). In November 2025, the US and Saudi Arabia completed negotiations on a civil nuclear cooperation framework. Saudi Arabia has also announced plans to develop domestic uranium enrichment capability -- a sensitive issue given proliferation concerns.

### UAE: Operational Success

The Barakah complex (four APR-1400 units) has vaulted UAE to approximately 36.5 TWh of nuclear generation, demonstrating that a first-time nuclear country can execute successfully with the right vendor partnership.

## Russian Nuclear Dominance and the HALEU Challenge

### Rosatom's Market Position

Russia's nuclear industrial complex under Rosatom maintains formidable positions across the fuel cycle:

- **Enrichment**: ~46% of global uranium enrichment capacity (SWU).
- **Conversion**: ~20% of global capacity.
- **HALEU**: Rosatom subsidiary Tenex is currently the only entity selling HALEU commercially worldwide.
- **US dependency**: Approximately 25% of enrichment services for US reactors were supplied from Russia in 2024.
- **EU dependency**: Russian companies supplied 22% of conversion and 38% of enrichment services to EU utilities in 2023.

### US Response: The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act

Signed May 13, 2024, this act bans imports of Russian-origin unirradiated LEU and natural uranium effective August 11, 2024, with waiver authority through 2027 for cases where no alternative supply exists. The legislation unlocked $2.72 billion in DOE appropriations for domestic enrichment investment.

### HALEU Supply Chain Development

HALEU (uranium enriched to 5-20% U-235) is required for most advanced reactor designs but has no Western commercial supply chain today.

**Centrus Energy (Piketon, Ohio)**:
- Completed Phase II delivery of 900 kg HALEU to DOE -- the first US-produced HALEU in decades.
- Phase III contract extension (~$110 million) runs through June 30, 2026 at 900 kg/year production rate.
- Awarded $900 million task order for commercial-scale expansion, including additional centrifuge cascades.
- Contract contains options for up to eight additional years of production beyond the current extension.

**Other Western Capacity Expansion**:
- Urenco Eunice facility: +0.7 million SWU by 2027.
- Urenco European sites: 2-2.4 million SWU by 2030.
- Orano Oak Ridge IKE facility: targeting 1 million SWU by 2030.

**Investment Implication**: The HALEU supply gap is one of the most critical constraints on advanced reactor deployment. Centrus has first-mover advantage but remains at pilot scale. Commercial-scale Western HALEU supply is unlikely before 2028-2030 at the earliest, creating a window of continued Russian leverage and potential deployment delays for advanced reactors.

## Nuclear Waste: From Liability to Potential Asset

### Current Storage Landscape

The US has accumulated approximately 90,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel stored at reactor sites across the country, with no permanent disposal pathway in operation.

**Yucca Mountain**: Designated as the permanent repository under the 1987 Nuclear Waste Policy Act but effectively stalled by Nevada political opposition. No meaningful progress expected in the near term.

**Consent-Based Siting**: The DOE has shifted toward a consent-based approach, seeking locations where state, local, and tribal governments agree to host waste facilities.

**Interim Storage (Supreme Court cleared)**:
- In June 2025, the US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to uphold NRC licenses for interim storage facilities, reversing a lower court decision.
- **Holtec International**: Licensed facility in Lea County, New Mexico (near WIPP), pending final legal resolution.
- **Interim Storage Partners**: NRC license (September 2021) for initial 5,000 metric ton capacity in West Texas, expandable to 40,000 metric tons.

### Reprocessing Renaissance

President Trump's May 2025 Executive Order on reinvigorating the nuclear industrial base directed the Secretary of Energy to recommend by January 2026 a national policy for spent fuel management, including evaluation of reprocessing and recycling. This marks the most significant policy shift since the US banned commercial reprocessing in 1977 over proliferation concerns.

Private sector entrants:
- **Orano/Shine Technologies**: Partnership announced February 2024 to develop a recycling plant by the 2030s.
- **Oklo**: Plans a $1.68 billion Advanced Fuel Recycling Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, targeting production by the early 2030s.

The strategic reframing is significant: spent fuel contains recoverable fissile material that could reduce foreign fuel dependency and feed advanced reactors. However, reprocessing carries proliferation risks, produces its own waste streams, and remains economically unproven at commercial scale in the US.

## Public Sentiment and Political Landscape

### Broad and Growing Support

Public support for nuclear energy has reached multi-decade highs:

- **Bisconti Research (2025)**: 72% of respondents favor nuclear energy use (down slightly from 77% in 2024, but still historically elevated).
- **Pew Research (2025)**: Approximately 60% of US adults favor more nuclear power plants, up from 43% in 2020.
- **Bipartisan gap narrowing**: 62% of Republicans, 56% of independents, and 46% of Democrats favor nuclear energy. The 18-point partisan gap is far narrower than for fossil fuel issues (45-48 point gaps for fracking, coal, offshore drilling).

### State-Level Zero Emission Credits

Five states have implemented ZEC programs to keep existing nuclear plants economically viable:
- **New York**: ZEC program supporting four reactors (Nine Mile Point 1 & 2, FitzPatrick, Ginna) that supply approximately 22% of state electricity. NYSERDA ZEC rate at 0.273 cents/kWh in 2025. Extension proposal under review (July 2025).
- **Illinois**: ZEC program for in-state nuclear fleet.
- **Prices range**: $10-17.50/MWh across programs in New York, Illinois, New Jersey, and Ohio, calibrated to social cost of carbon and energy market prices.

## Geopolitical Dimensions

### Energy Security Post-Ukraine

Russia's invasion of Ukraine transformed nuclear fuel supply from a commercial issue into a national security imperative. The realization that Rosatom could theoretically leverage fuel supply as a geopolitical weapon has accelerated Western decoupling efforts across enrichment, conversion, and fuel fabrication.

### SMR Export Competition

The SMR export market has become a geopolitical battleground:
- **Russia (Rosatom)**: Deployed RITM-200 units internationally; six reactors under construction in Uzbekistan; signed MoU with ASEAN Centre for Energy (October 2025) for technology transfer and infrastructure support.
- **China**: Linglong One positioned for Belt and Road export alongside domestic deployment.
- **South Korea**: APR-1400 export track record; pursuing European tenders.
- **US**: Multiple SMR designs in development but none yet deployed commercially; regulatory reform aims to accelerate licensing for export competitiveness.

The geopolitical stakes are high: reactor exports create decades-long fuel supply relationships, technical dependencies, and strategic influence. Countries that deploy first in emerging markets establish durable partnerships.

### NATO and Allied Coordination

Western allies are increasingly coordinating on nuclear fuel supply security and regulatory harmonization. The US-UK-France-Canada axis is working to create interoperable licensing frameworks that could accelerate deployment and counter Russian/Chinese market penetration.

## Key Risk Factors for Investors

### Construction Cost Discipline

Vogtle Units 3 & 4 remain the cautionary benchmark: original estimates of approximately $14 billion ballooned to over $35 billion, with the primary contractor (Westinghouse) going bankrupt in 2017. Key failures included off-site modular construction that required extensive on-site rework, management and planning deficiencies, and first-of-a-kind (FOAK) learning curve costs.

Future cost projections suggest meaningful learning-curve reductions: MIT modeling projects overnight costs declining from $10,000/kWe (second AP1000 project) to $6,200/kWe (fourth project), with construction timelines shrinking from 7 to 5.5 years. However, these projections require sustained order flow and industrial learning that has not yet been demonstrated in the US.

### NRC Execution Risk

The combination of ambitious reform mandates (EO 14300, ADVANCE Act, Part 53) and a shrinking workforce creates substantial execution risk. If the NRC cannot meet its licensing deadlines, the entire policy framework underperforms.

### HALEU Supply Timeline

Advanced reactors requiring HALEU face a chicken-and-egg problem: fuel suppliers need committed reactor orders to justify capacity investment, while reactor developers need assured fuel supply to proceed. The US is investing heavily but commercial-scale Western HALEU remains years away.

### Political Durability

While nuclear enjoys genuine bipartisan support -- rare in US energy policy -- the specific incentive mechanisms (IRA tax credits, DOE loan authority) face some political risk from budget negotiations and potential legislative changes.

### Permitting and Siting

Even with NRC reform, new nuclear projects face permitting challenges at the state and local level, including environmental reviews, grid interconnection, and community acceptance. These processes can add years to project timelines independently of federal licensing.
