# Defense & Government Cybersecurity

## Sector Overview

Defense and government cybersecurity represents one of the most durable growth segments in the broader cyber market, driven by escalating nation-state threats, regulatory mandates, and the modernization of aging federal IT infrastructure. The federal cybersecurity market is estimated at $18.8 billion in FY2026, growing to $20.7 billion by FY2028 (Deltek). The DoD alone requested $15.1 billion for cyberspace activities in FY2026, a 4.1% increase over the prior year. Total U.S. government cybersecurity spending exceeds $25 billion annually when including intelligence community and classified programs.

Key tailwinds include the CMMC compliance wave, zero trust mandates, classified cloud buildout, and intensifying cyber warfare posture driven by China's Volt Typhoon and Russia's Sandworm. FY2026 also brings a countervailing force: proposed budget cuts to civilian cybersecurity (particularly CISA), shifting spending toward defense and away from civilian agencies.

**Key Tickers:** BAH, LDOS, CACI, PLTR, PSN, TLS

## Federal Cyber Budget Landscape

### FY2025-FY2026 Spending

The Biden administration's FY2025 budget allocated $13 billion in cybersecurity funding across the federal government, with $3 billion designated for CISA. This represented a continuation of the upward spending trajectory that has characterized federal cyber investment since the SolarWinds breach in 2020.

The FY2026 picture is more complex. The Trump administration's budget request proposed a $1.23 billion cut (10% reduction) in cybersecurity spending for civilian agencies compared to 2024 levels. CISA bore the brunt, with initial proposals to cut $491 million (17%) and more than 1,000 staff. The House Homeland Security Committee ultimately appropriated $2.74 billion for CISA, a $146 million (5%) reduction from FY2025. CISA staffing dropped from approximately 3,700 to between 2,200 and 2,600 employees, with DOGE-driven layoffs eliminating critical red team personnel and threatening the CVE program managed by MITRE.

However, defense cybersecurity spending moved in the opposite direction. The Pentagon's FY2026 budget request includes $15.1 billion for cyberspace activities, broken down as:

| Category | FY2026 Request | Key Programs |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Cybersecurity | $9.1B | Information assurance, weapons systems OT, supply chain risk, cryptographic modernization |
| Cyberspace Operations | $5.4B | CYBERCOM ($2.6B), Cyber Mission Force ($1.3B), headquarters ($314M) |
| Cyber R&D | $612M | Next-gen capabilities, zero trust acceleration |

The 2026 NDAA further boosted the Pentagon's cyber budget to $15 billion with bipartisan support, reflecting congressional consensus that defense cyber capabilities are a national priority regardless of the broader austerity push.

**Investment Implication:** The divergence between civilian cuts and defense increases favors contractors with heavy DoD/IC exposure (BAH, LDOS, CACI) over those dependent on civilian agency work. Companies with mixed portfolios face margin pressure on their civil segments.

## Government/Defense Cyber Contractors

### Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) -- Market Cap: ~$10.7B

Booz Allen is the largest federal cybersecurity provider by prime contract obligations (FY2021-2023, per Deltek), with projected cyber revenue of $2.5-2.8 billion in FY2025, representing nearly a quarter of total company revenue. The company employs over 8,000 cyber professionals across nearly 300 active cyber projects spanning offensive and defensive government missions.

**VoLT Strategy:** The VoLT (Velocity, Leadership, Technology) strategy and "One Battlespace" approach treat cyber as a single expanding attack surface across defense, intelligence, civilian, and commercial infrastructure.

**FY2026 Challenges:** Revenue guidance cut by ~$850M at midpoint, shifting from 0-4% growth to 4-6% decline YoY. FY2026 guidance: $11.3-11.5B revenue, $5.45-5.65 EPS. Civil business contracted 22% in Q2 FY2026 while national security grew. Management initiated $150M annualized cost reductions. Stock trades near 52-week low ($79-89 vs. $131 high), potentially a value entry point.

**Bull Case:** Dominant federal cyber position, deep IC/DoD relationships, AI+cyber convergence, $2.5B+ cyber revenue base provides stability even as civil declines. Trading at compressed multiples relative to defense peers.

**Bear Case:** Civil segment decline may not be temporary; DOGE-driven procurement stagnation could persist. Revenue guidance cuts erode confidence. Cost reduction program may not fully offset headwinds.

### CACI International (CACI) -- Market Cap: ~$11.3B

CACI has emerged as one of the strongest performers in the defense IT/cyber space, with FY2025 annual revenue of $8.63 billion (12.6% growth) and Q1 FY2026 revenue of $2.3 billion (up 11.2% YoY). The company's total backlog reached $33.9 billion at end of Q1 FY2026, up 4.6% year-over-year, with funded backlog surging 25.6% to $5.4 billion. Q1 contract awards totaled $5 billion, with approximately 60% representing new business.

**Electronic Warfare Dominance:** CEO John Mengucci revealed that CACI's electronic warfare business now represents approximately $2 billion in revenue, encompassing counter-UAS capabilities. CACI's differentiated software-defined EW architecture, with a common baseline across multiple sensors, has proven increasingly relevant to current military operations, particularly given lessons from Ukraine.

**FY2026 Guidance:** Raised on EW momentum and contract wins, with adjusted EPS guidance of $28.03. SIGINT/EW/cyber convergence aligns with DoD digital transformation priorities.

**Bull Case:** Best-in-class organic growth among defense IT peers, massive backlog provides multi-year revenue visibility, EW leadership in a rapidly growing domain, no meaningful civil exposure risk.

**Bear Case:** Valuation has expanded significantly on growth trajectory; any slowdown in contract awards could trigger multiple compression. Concentration in DoD/IC creates policy risk.

### Leidos (LDOS) -- Market Cap: ~$23.5B

Leidos is the largest pure-play defense IT/cyber contractor by revenue, with TTM revenue of approximately $17.3 billion and a record backlog of $46.2 billion (up 11% YoY). The company achieved over $700 million in new and takeaway cyber wins, reflecting strong competitive positioning within the intelligence community.

**NorthStar 2030 Strategy:** Five-pillar growth framework explicitly targets cyber and digital modernization as core vectors. Acquired Kudu Dynamics (May 2025) for AI-enabled cyber capabilities; partnered with RegScale and Trustible for automated cybersecurity monitoring.

**FY2025 Performance:** Revenue guidance raised to $17.0-17.25B, non-GAAP EPS $11.15-11.45, operating cash flow ~$1.65B. Q2 EPS jumped 22%.

**Bull Case:** Largest backlog in the sector provides exceptional revenue visibility, NorthStar 2030 creates clear strategic direction, classified cyber programs provide durable moats, strong cash generation supports capital returns.

**Bear Case:** Scale makes it harder to sustain growth rates; funded backlog ($7.1B) is a fraction of total backlog ($46.2B), reflecting dependency on future appropriations. Health segment creates diversification but also dilutes the defense tech narrative.

### ManTech (Private -- Carlyle Group)

Taken private by Carlyle in September 2022 for $4.2 billion ($96/share). Nearly 10,000 employees, $2.5B+ revenue. Under Carlyle, capital emphasis shifted to cybersecurity, zero trust, AI/ML, and digital engineering. A potential re-IPO candidate in the 2026-2028 timeframe given Carlyle's typical hold period.

## Adjacent Players

### Palantir Technologies (PLTR) -- Market Cap: ~$322B

Palantir has become a dominant force in government AI and data analytics, with its market cap surging past $300 billion on the strength of explosive growth. The company reported its first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter and guided FY2026 revenue to $7.18-7.20 billion, substantially beating the $6.22 billion consensus. U.S. government revenue grew 66% year-over-year, with federal contracts nearly doubling to $970.5 million in 2025.

**Key Programs:** Maven Smart System ($795M ceiling increase), Army enterprise agreement (10-year, up to $10B), Navy shipbuilding ($448M), FedStart compliance platform, CMMC Level 2 + FedRAMP High + DoD IL6 certified.

**Investment Consideration:** Valuation (45x+ forward revenue) prices in years of hypergrowth. Government segment provides stability but commercial acceleration is the primary driver at this scale. Extreme premium vs. traditional defense contractors.

### Parsons Corporation (PSN) -- Market Cap: ~$7.4B

Parsons has positioned itself as a growth-oriented defense technology company through aggressive M&A. Q3 2025 revenue hit $1.8 billion (28% YoY growth), driven by acquisitions including a $137 million DTRA cyber operations contract and positioning on the MDA SHIELD IDIQ ($151 billion ceiling). The Altamira acquisition ($375 million) is expected to generate over $200 million in revenue in 2026.

Parsons' strategic focus on cybersecurity, space defense, and critical infrastructure, combined with accretive M&A execution, makes it a compelling mid-cap play on defense modernization. The company reports FY2025 results on February 11, 2026.

### Telos Corporation (TLS) -- Market Cap: ~$477M

Telos provides cyber, cloud, and enterprise security solutions through its Xacta platform for cyber risk management and security compliance automation. TTM revenue is approximately $140 million, though Q2 2025 showed 26% YoY growth to $36 million and a return to positive adjusted EBITDA. The pipeline stands at approximately $5 billion.

The Xacta.ai product launch could be transformative, with the first enterprise customer reporting up to 93% efficiency improvements in compliance processes. Telos is also expanding its TSA PreCheck enrollment network (now 500+ locations). However, the company's small scale creates execution risk, and revenue has been volatile.

### BigBear.ai (BBAI) -- Market Cap: ~$2.5B

BigBear.ai provides AI-driven analytics and cybersecurity for national security customers. TTM revenue $144M (down 7% YoY), but pivoting toward defense-aligned generative AI via the $250M Ask Sage acquisition. Government gen-AI pipeline grew 8x since 2023. Speculative play -- revenue must inflect before thesis is validated.

## CMMC 2.0 Compliance

### Rollout Timeline

The CMMC 2.0 rollout officially began on November 10, 2025, following years of delays. Implementation follows a phased approach:

| Phase | Date | Requirements |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Nov 10, 2025 | Level 1 and Level 2 self-assessments required as pre-award condition; DoD may also require Level 2 C3PAO assessments |
| Phase 2 | Nov 10, 2026 | Most DIB organizations handling CUI must have Level 2 C3PAO certification for new/renewing contracts |
| Phase 3 | Nov 10, 2027 | Level 3 assessments for critical CUI against APTs |
| Full Enforcement | ~2028 | Every DIB contractor expected to be CMMC certified |

### Three-Tier Framework

- **Level 1 (Foundational):** Protects Federal Contract Information (FCI); 17 practices based on FAR 52.204-21; self-assessment
- **Level 2 (Advanced):** Protects Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI); 110 controls from NIST SP 800-171; third-party C3PAO assessment required
- **Level 3 (Expert):** Protects critical CUI against APTs; 134+ controls including NIST SP 800-172 enhancements; government-led assessment

### Market Impact and Revenue Opportunity

The CMMC compliance wave is creating a substantial market for tools, services, and assessments:

- **Scale:** 220,000+ contractors and subcontractors impacted; approximately 80,000 expected to require Level 2 certification
- **Assessment Ecosystem:** Fewer than 100 C3PAOs are currently accredited, creating a massive supply-demand imbalance. The DoD estimates approximately 8,350 medium and large entities will need Level 2 third-party assessments
- **Assessment Costs:** Current range of $40,000-$80,000 per C3PAO assessment, expected to rise to $75,000-$150,000 by late 2026 due to demand. This does not include RPO services, licensing, or remediation costs
- **Readiness Gap:** Only approximately 200 defense contractors have completed C3PAO assessments against a need of 80,000. Reports suggest 30-50% of companies presenting for assessment are not ready
- **Timeline Pressure:** Average Level 2 certification takes 18-36+ months from gap assessment to audit-ready, with C3PAO wait times stretching 3-6 months

**Investment Implication:** CMMC creates a multi-billion-dollar compliance market over 2025-2028. Key beneficiaries include compliance automation platforms (Telos/Xacta, Palantir/FedStart), managed security service providers serving the DIB, and C3PAO assessment firms. Companies that fail to achieve certification face exclusion from defense contracts, creating a "comply or die" dynamic that ensures sustained demand.

## Offensive Cyber Programs

CYBERCOM's FY2026 budget of ~$2.6 billion funds the Cyber Mission Force ($1.3B) and headquarters ($314M). The CNMF has expanded to 39 joint cyber teams (2,000+ members), with 12 of 14 new teams now operational. The "CYBERCOM 2.0" initiative is modernizing force generation by integrating with military departments for recruitment, training, and retention.

Hunt-forward operations are central to U.S. cyber deterrence, with teams deploying to allied nations to identify adversary intrusions and gather intelligence on TTPs. The global cyber warfare market was valued at $38.2 billion in 2025, projected to reach $52.57 billion by 2031 (5.47% CAGR). The Five Eyes alliance continues deepening cooperation through joint advisories, coordinated attribution, and collaborative operations.

---

## Nation-State Cyber Threats

### China: Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon

Volt Typhoon, a PLA/MSS-affiliated APT, has maintained persistent access to U.S. critical infrastructure (electric utilities, telecom, water, transportation) for at least five years, pre-positioning destructive capabilities for a potential Taiwan-related conflict. The group uses living-off-the-land techniques to evade detection. The 2025 IC Annual Threat Assessment assessed China is "probably setting the conditions to execute destructive cyberattacks." Salt Typhoon separately breached multiple U.S. telecom carriers, accessing call records and metadata. Australia's ASIO confirmed similar Chinese targeting of Australian infrastructure in November 2025.

### Russia, North Korea, Iran

Russia's Sandworm (GRU Unit 74455) deployed new wiper malware (Zerolot, Sting) against Ukrainian government, energy, and logistics targets in 2025. North Korean APTs focus on cryptocurrency theft and geopolitical intelligence. Iran's MuddyWater escalated spear-phishing via compromised internal accounts. Evidence increasingly points to collaboration among adversary nations, with Chinese and Russian actors sharing malware and exploit kits.

**Investment Implication:** Persistent nation-state threats ensure sustained demand for federal cyber capabilities regardless of political cycles.

---

## CISA Mandates and Federal Cybersecurity Policy

### Binding Operational Directives (BODs)

CISA's BODs are mandatory for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies and serve as de facto standards for the broader market:

- **BOD 22-01 (KEV Catalog):** Requires FCEB agencies to remediate Known Exploited Vulnerabilities within two weeks (post-2021 CVEs) or six months (pre-2021). The KEV catalog grew by 1,484 vulnerabilities in 2025 alone, creating continuous patching pressure
- **BOD 26-02:** New directive requiring mitigation of risks from end-of-support edge devices, reflecting the growing attack surface from legacy networking equipment

### Zero Trust Mandate (OMB M-22-09)

OMB M-22-09 established a federal zero trust strategy aligned to CISA's Zero Trust Maturity Model, requiring agencies to meet specific cybersecurity objectives by end of FY2024. While the original deadline has passed, zero trust remains the overarching federal cybersecurity architecture framework, with FY2025 guidance (M-25-04) continuing to emphasize deployment of critical security tools and zero trust enablement. Multi-year zero trust implementation programs continue to drive significant vendor spending across identity, network, and endpoint security.

### CIRCIA (Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure)

The CIRCIA final rule, implementing the 2022 Act, has been delayed to May 2026. When finalized, it will require critical infrastructure operators to notify CISA within 72 hours of discovering a covered cyber incident and within 24 hours of making a ransomware payment. This creates a new compliance obligation for approximately 316,000 entities across 16 critical infrastructure sectors.

**Political Risk:** CISA's reduced staffing and budget create enforcement uncertainty, but most BODs and zero trust requirements are embedded in existing policy. The KEV catalog has been widely adopted beyond federal agencies and is unlikely to be discontinued.

---

## FedRAMP and Cloud Authorization

### FedRAMP Modernization

FedRAMP completed a historic 144 authorizations in FY2025, eliminating the longstanding authorization backlog. The program is undergoing significant modernization:

- **FedRAMP 20x:** A new streamlined authorization pathway that allows cloud service providers to obtain program authorizations at Levels 1-4 without an agency sponsor, expected to open for Low and Moderate authorizations in February 2026
- **Rev 5 Transition:** Providers demonstrating substantial progress toward Rev 5 certification can obtain authorizations through December 16, 2026, with new machine-readable package requirements
- **Security Inbox Requirements:** Effective January 5, 2026, applying to all CSPs across both 20x and Rev 5 pathways

The 20x streamlining represents a fundamental shift in FedRAMP's approach, potentially reducing authorization timelines from 12-18 months to weeks for lower-impact systems. This is bullish for commercial cloud vendors seeking government market entry.

### GovRAMP (formerly StateRAMP)

StateRAMP rebranded to GovRAMP in February 2025 to reflect its expanded mission across state, local, tribal, and educational entities. Adopted by 27 states, with new requirements effective January 1, 2026.

---

## Classified Cloud

Four hyperscalers compete through the $9 billion JWCC contract for classified workloads across all security domains:

| Provider | Capabilities | Key Developments |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **AWS** | C2S (Top Secret), SC2S (Secret), GovCloud | $50B planned investment in federal AI infrastructure; 1.3 GW capacity; construction begins 2026 |
| **Microsoft Azure** | IL6/ICD 503 Secret, Top Secret regions | GPT-5.2 deployed in Secret and Top Secret clouds; 3 new AZs in Gov Arizona (early 2026) |
| **Oracle** | 3x IL5, 3x IL6 Secret, air-gapped Top Secret | OneGov agreement via GSA (July 2025) |
| **Google** | GDC IL6, GDC air-gapped Top Secret | $200M CDAO contract, $48M DLA deal, UK MOD sovereign cloud, NATO contracts |

The classified cloud buildout is accelerating as DoD/IC agencies deploy AI (particularly LLMs) into classified environments. Microsoft's GPT-5.2 in Secret/Top Secret clouds signals the AI race has extended into the classified domain, creating potential for massive workload migration from legacy on-premises systems.

---

## Cyber Warfare Doctrine

U.S. cyber doctrine has evolved from reactive defense to "persistent engagement" and "defend forward," meaning CYBERCOM operates continuously in foreign networks to disrupt threats before they reach U.S. systems. This drives investment in offensive hunt teams, intelligence collection, AI-powered threat detection, and allied capacity building.

Cyber deterrence remains an unsolved policy problem: unlike nuclear deterrence, cyber capabilities must be used to be demonstrated, attribution is difficult, and escalation thresholds are ambiguous. The current strategic environment favors offense, as attackers choose targets and timing while defenders must protect vast attack surfaces. This asymmetry drives demand for zero trust architectures, automated defense, threat hunting, and supply chain security.

---

## Market Sizing Summary

| Segment | 2025-2026 Estimate | 2028-2031 Forecast | Growth Driver |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Federal cybersecurity (total) | $25B+ annually | $20.7B vendor market by 2028 | Zero trust, CMMC, threat escalation |
| DoD cyberspace activities | $15.1B (FY2026) | Growing at ~4% annually | Cyber Mission Force, offensive ops |
| CMMC compliance market | Ramping (2025-2028) | $2-5B cumulative | 220K+ contractors, assessment fees |
| Global cyber warfare | $38.2B (2025) | $52.6B by 2031 | Nation-state competition, AI weapons |
| Classified cloud (JWCC) | $9B ceiling contract | Expanding significantly | AI in classified environments |
| U.S. cybersecurity (total market) | $92.7B (2025) | $144B by 2031 | Enterprise + government combined |

---

## Competitive Dynamics

### Consolidation and Barriers

The market is consolidating through strategic M&A (Leidos/Kudu Dynamics, CACI/Applied Insight, Parsons/Altamira, BigBear.ai/Ask Sage) and PE take-privates (Carlyle/ManTech). Customers increasingly prefer integrated solutions spanning cyber, AI, EW, and cloud.

Barriers to entry are exceptionally high: security clearances (6-18 months, non-transferable), past performance requirements, FedRAMP/CMMC/ITAR compliance costs, deep incumbent relationships, and classified program opacity that creates self-reinforcing moats.

### DOGE and Budget Risk

DOGE-driven cuts at CISA and civilian agencies create near-term uncertainty but may benefit defense contractors. Reduced CISA capabilities may drive agencies to rely more on contractor-provided security. Defense spending is explicitly excluded from DOGE's purview. However, loss of critical programs (CISA red teams, CVE database funding) creates genuine capability gaps that could affect the broader ecosystem.

---

## Risk Factors

1. **Continuing Resolutions:** Extended CRs prevent new program starts and limit spending to prior-year levels
2. **Political Risk:** DOGE-era CISA cuts signal potential erosion of bipartisan cyber consensus on civilian side
3. **Workforce Shortage:** 500,000+ unfilled cyber positions nationally limits program execution
4. **AI Disruption:** Could compress project timelines and reduce labor content in traditional defense IT models
5. **CMMC Execution:** C3PAO ecosystem may not scale fast enough, creating uneven enforcement
6. **Valuation Dispersion:** Wide gaps between traditional contractors (BAH) and AI-defense names (PLTR) create positioning challenges

---

## Investment Themes

1. **Defense Cyber Incumbents (BAH, LDOS, CACI):** BAH at depressed multiples offers value if the defense pivot succeeds; LDOS provides scale and the largest backlog ($46.2B); CACI has the strongest momentum with 11%+ organic growth and EW leadership.

2. **CMMC Compliance Wave:** The 2025-2028 rollout creates a multi-billion-dollar compliance market. Key beneficiaries: compliance automation platforms (TLS/Xacta, PLTR/FedStart), managed security providers, C3PAO firms.

3. **AI-Defense Convergence:** GPT-5.2 in classified clouds signals the next modernization wave. PLTR is the highest-profile play at extreme valuations; LDOS and CACI offer AI integration at reasonable multiples; BBAI is speculative.

4. **Classified Cloud Buildout:** AWS's $50B investment underscores scale. Primarily benefits hyperscalers, but defense contractors providing migration services and security overlays capture adjacent revenue.
