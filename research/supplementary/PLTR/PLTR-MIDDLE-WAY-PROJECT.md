## Overview
A balanced deep-dive thesis on Palantir Technologies ($PLTR) that rejects both the permabull and Burry bear extremes, identifying moat erosion on the commercial side as the key variable both camps are mispricing.

## Core Thesis
Palantir is two businesses masquerading as one:
1. **Defense/Government** — Wide, widening moat (regulatory). AI advancement helps.
2. **US Commercial** — Real but narrowing moat (technological). Competition converging.

The stock is priced as if both moats are invincible. The commercial moat is not.

## Deliverables
- [x] `middle-way-pltr.html` — Full themed report (Zen/Middle Way aesthetic)
- [ ] Valuation model (DCF with split business segments)
- [ ] Technical chart analysis with key levels
- [ ] Trade structure document (options strategies)

## Key Research Sources
- Michael Burry's Cassandra Unchained Substack (10K word PLTR piece, Feb 2026)
- Burry Q3 2025 13F: $912M PLTR puts, $187M NVDA puts
- Q4 2025 earnings: 70% YoY growth, $7.2B 2026 guide
- Microsoft Fabric IQ (Ignite 2025 launch — competing ontology)
- UiPath Maestro (AI orchestration, 10,800 customers)
- SaaSpocalypse context ($300B SaaS wipeout Jan-Feb 2026)

| Security/Clearances | Wide | Widening |
| Ontology | Narrowing | MS Fabric IQ threat |
| Data Integration | Narrowing | Open standards |
| AI Orchestration | Narrowing | UiPath, AWS, many |
| Switching Costs | Wide (existing) | New customer risk |
