Morning brief written to `/home/spicymeatball/projects/bigpic-markets/morning-brief/2026-02/2026-02-26_Thu.md`.

**Summary of today's HEAVY event load:**

- **8 watchlist earnings before the open** — ZS, RKLB, VST, MP, LYSCF, ESTC, TLN, UUUU spanning cybersecurity, space, nuclear, and critical minerals
- **NVIDIA's muted reaction** to record $215B annual revenue is the key sentiment signal — even blowout AI earnings aren't lifting mega-caps
- **IONQ +15.12%** on first $100M revenue milestone for a pure-play quantum company
- **Cybersecurity deeply oversold** — PANW (RSI 29), ZS (RSI 32), CRWD (RSI 34). Today's ZS/ESTC results are critical
- **Claims at 13:30 ET** (217K consensus vs. 206K prior) is the macro swing factor ahead of the March 17-18 FOMC
- **Key convergence approaching**: March 18 FOMC (first 2026 dot plot) + March 20 Triple Witch — positioning starts March 9
- **Bias: NEUTRAL** — flat futures, muted NVDA reaction, oil weakness, but VIX drifting lower and crypto strength provide balance

~2,800 words, calibrated for HEAVY depth.
