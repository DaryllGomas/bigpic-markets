- **Bond market screaming safety** — 10Y yield collapsed to 3.989% (z-score -3.2) despite hot inflation data
- **25+ watchlist names down >3%** — only defense primes (LMT, NOC, RTX) in the green
- **Key catalysts ahead** — CRWD earnings Mar 3, AVGO Mar 4, Artemis II Mar 6, FOMC + Triple Witch convergence Mar 17-20
- **Notable news** — Rocket Lab delays Neutron to late 2026, OpenAI closes $110B round, Block +24% on radical restructuring, D-Wave reports 179% revenue growth (stock still down 5%)
