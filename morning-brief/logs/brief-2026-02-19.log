The morning brief has been written to `/home/spicymeatball/projects/bigpic-markets/morning-brief/2026-02/2026-02-19_Thu.md`.

**Summary of today's HEAVY brief (~2,800 words):**

- **Bias: BEARISH** — Hawkish FOMC minutes (rate hike discussion), U.S.-Iran oil surge, WMT guidance miss, Bitcoin's longest losing streak since 2022
- **VIX at 20.28** — elevated and rising, confirming risk-off regime
- **Key levels:** S&P 6,850 support, VIX 21.0 escalation trigger, 10Y 4.10% resistance, WTI $67 inflation fear threshold
- **Critical watchlist signals:** Cybersecurity sector deeply oversold (ZS RSI 20, PANW 26, CRWD 34); FLNC RSI 17 is the most oversold name despite strong fundamentals; LEU sitting exactly on SMA200 — inflection point
- **Next week is massive:** NVDA (Tue), CEG (Mon), and a 5-name cluster on Wed (RKLB, ZS, VST, MP, LYSCF) spanning four sectors
- **Catalysts approaching:** Palisades restart, Artemis II (Mar 6), AVGO earnings (Mar 4), Cerebras IPO (Q2), SpaceX IPO (mid-2026)
