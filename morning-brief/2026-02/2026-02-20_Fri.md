# BigPic Morning Brief

## Event Load: HEAVY — Friday, February 20, 2026

Triple macro data dump (GDP + Core PCE + Flash PMIs), monthly options expiration, pending Supreme Court tariff ruling, and U.S.-Iran geopolitical risk. This is the heaviest calendar of the week. Position accordingly.

**Color:** Risk-off posture into the data deluge. Gold pressing higher while equities drift lower — classic pre-event hedging. VIX above 20 with OpEx creates potential for amplified intraday moves. The Russell underperformance (-0.37% vs -0.12% SPX) signals risk appetite is weakest in the most economically sensitive segment.

## Overnight & Global Markets

| Market | Level | Change | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nikkei 225 | 56,826 | -1.12% | schwab |
| Hang Seng | 26,413 | -1.10% | schwab |
| Kospi | 5,809 | +1.96% | stooq |
| DAX | 25,069 | +0.10% | schwab |
| CAC 40 | 8,463 | +0.76% | schwab |
| FTSE 100 | 10,680 | +0.49% | stooq |
| Europe STOXX 50 (FEZ) | 67.51 | -0.40% | schwab |
| Australia (EWA) | 29.55 | +0.61% | schwab |

**Asia Session:** Broad weakness. Nikkei fell 1.12% after Japan CPI dropped below the BOJ's 2% target for the first time since March 2022 — raising questions about the BOJ's tightening trajectory. Hang Seng dropped 1.10% (flagged as anomalous, z-score: -4.0), signaling continued HK/China risk aversion. Kospi was the outlier at +1.96%, bucking the regional trend.

**Europe Session:** Mixed but constructive. CAC 40 led at +0.76% (flagged anomalous, z-score: 3.3) as European defense and luxury names continue to benefit from rearmament spending and weaker euro. FTSE +0.49%. DAX barely green. The FEZ ETF at -0.40% reflects hedging ahead of US data.

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Event | Impact | Consensus | Prior | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| All Day | Monthly Options Expiration | Medium | — | — | Pending |
| 13:30 | **Advance GDP q/q** | **HIGH** | 2.8% | 3.0% | Pending |
| 13:30 | **Core PCE Price Index m/m** | **HIGH** | 0.3% | 0.2% | Pending |
| 13:30 | Advance GDP Price Index q/q | Medium | 2.8% | 2.0% | Pending |
| 13:30 | Personal Income m/m | Low | 0.3% | 0.3% | Pending |
| 13:30 | Personal Spending m/m | Low | 0.4% | 0.5% | Pending |
| 14:45 | **Flash Manufacturing PMI** | **HIGH** | 52.4 | 51.9 | Pending |
| 14:45 | **Flash Services PMI** | **HIGH** | 53.0 | 52.5 | Pending |
| 14:45 | FOMC Member Bostic Speaks | Low | — | — | Pending |
| 15:00 | New Home Sales | Medium | — | 737K | Pending |
| 15:00 | Revised UoM Consumer Sentiment | Low | 56.9 | 57.3 | Pending |
| 15:00 | Revised UoM Inflation Expectations | Low | — | 3.5% | Pending |
| 17:45 | FOMC Member Logan Speaks | Low | — | — | Pending |

**The 13:30 ET block is the main event.** GDP expected to decelerate from 3.0% to 2.8% — still solid. Core PCE at 0.3% m/m (up from 0.2%) would be a mild hot print. The GDP Price Index jumping from 2.0% to 2.8% consensus is the stealth concern — stagflationary if GDP misses low while price index comes in hot.

**Scenario Matrix:**
- **Bull case:** GDP in-line or above + Core PCE at 0.2% or below. Growth resilient, inflation cooling. Rally into close.
- **Base case:** GDP 2.7-2.9% + Core PCE 0.3%. Slight deceleration, sticky inflation. Choppy but contained.
- **Bear case:** GDP below 2.5% + Core PCE 0.4%+. Stagflation scare. VIX spikes, yields whipsaw, equities sell off into OpEx close.

**Additional wildcard:** Supreme Court tariff ruling could drop at any time today. Markets are not fully pricing this.

## Thesis Watchlist Update

### Earnings — Today
No watchlist tickers reporting today.

### Upcoming Watchlist Earnings (Next 2 Weeks)

| Date | Symbol | Sector | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feb 24 | **CEG** | Nuclear Energy | Before open |
| Feb 25 | **NVDA** | AI Infrastructure | Before open |
| Feb 26 | **ZS** | Cybersecurity | Before open |
| Feb 26 | **VST** | Nuclear Energy | Before open |
| Feb 26 | **RKLB** | Space | Before open |
| Feb 26 | **MP** | Critical Minerals | Before open |
| Mar 3 | **CRWD** | Cybersecurity | Before open |
| Mar 4 | **AVGO** | AI Infrastructure | Before open |

**Next week is a wall of Tier 1 earnings.** NVDA on Tuesday is the marquee event. CEG on Monday kicks off nuclear fleet operator season. ZS, VST, RKLB, and MP all report Wednesday. Position sizing ahead of this cluster matters.

### Notable Tier 1 Technical Signals

**Overbought (RSI > 70):**
| Symbol | Sector | RSI | Price vs SMAs |
|---|---|---|---|
| CGNX | Robotics | 75 | Well above all SMAs — extended |
| LMT | Defense | 74 | $667 vs SMA200 $488 — +37% above 200d |
| VRT | AI Infra | 72 | $242 vs SMA200 $151 — +60% above 200d |
| NOC | Defense | 71 | $737 vs SMA200 $572 — +29% above 200d |
| HON | Quantum | 70 | $241 vs SMA200 $207 — approaching overbought |

**Oversold (RSI < 35):**
| Symbol | Sector | RSI | Price vs SMAs |
|---|---|---|---|
| PANW | Cybersecurity | 29 | $151 vs SMA200 $193 — 22% below 200d |
| ZS | Cybersecurity | 29 | $170 vs SMA200 $268 — 37% below 200d |
| IBM | Quantum | 32 | $256 vs SMA200 $280 — anomalous (z: -3.8) |
| FLNC | Energy Storage | 33 | $16.60 vs SMA200 $13.63 — above 200d but weak momentum |

**PANW and ZS both at RSI 29 is striking.** Both are Tier 1 cybersecurity names deeply oversold heading into ZS earnings Feb 26. The cyber thesis remains structurally intact (platform consolidation, CMMC compliance wave, AI-powered defense demand). These levels warrant watchlist attention for mean-reversion entries.

### Approaching Catalysts (from Thesis Files)

| Timeframe | Catalyst | Tickers |
|---|---|---|
| Feb 24-26 | CEG, NVDA, ZS, VST, RKLB, MP earnings cluster | Multiple Tier 1 |
| Feb-Mar 2026 | Palisades nuclear restart (first US plant reactivated from decommissioning) | CEG, VST context |
| Mar 6, 2026 | Artemis II launch | LUNR, RKLB, space sector |
| Mar 27, 2026 | NRC Part 53 final rule (technology-inclusive licensing for advanced reactors) | Nuclear sector |
| Q1 2026 | TerraPower construction permit expected | Nuclear sector |
| Q1 2026 | Denison Phoenix construction-ready | DNN |
| Q2 2026 | Freeport Grasberg phased restart | FCX |
| Mid-2026 | SpaceX IPO (~$1.5T) — sector-defining event | RKLB, PL, LUNR |
| Mid-2026 | NVIDIA Rubin architecture | NVDA, TSM |

**Today's news directly advances multiple thesis catalysts:** DNN's final permit for Phoenix (nuclear fuel cycle thesis), LAC's $1.6B Thacker Pass financing (critical minerals onshoring), RIO's Nemaska lithium consolidation (lithium supply chain), and NOC/BA defense contract activity.

## Market Context & Playbook

### VIX Regime Assessment
- **Level:** 20.51 (+1.38%)
- **Regime:** Elevated — above the 20 threshold that historically signals institutional hedging demand
- **Context:** Options expiration amplifies gamma effects. With VIX elevated and major data incoming, expect outsized intraday moves in both directions

### Today's Bias: **Cautious / Neutral-Bearish**

**Rationale:**
1. SPY trend is bearish per market context data
2. VIX elevated and rising into data + OpEx
3. Russell 2000 leading weakness suggests risk appetite is thinning
4. Gold at $5,044 (+0.92%) bidding as a safe haven
5. Asia sold off meaningfully overnight (Nikkei -1.12%, HSI -1.10%)
6. U.S.-Iran tensions adding geopolitical risk premium
7. Stagflation risk if GDP misses low while GDP Price Index prints hot

**Counterbalances:**
- Europe green; not a global risk-off rout
- Bitcoin bouncing; crypto fear may be peaking
- Futures losses are modest (-0.12% SPX); no panic
- AMZN revenue milestone and defense deal flow provide positive sector narratives

### Key Levels

| Level | Significance |
|---|---|
| SPX 6,862 | Prior close — immediate support |
| SPX 6,869 | Pre-market futures — testing above prior close |
| SPY SMA200 = 651 | Far below current level; trend remains intact on long-term basis |
| VIX 20.51 | Above 20 = elevated hedging; watch for spike above 22 on data miss |
| Gold $5,044 | New highs; safe-haven bid accelerating |
| 10Y 4.075% | Key yield level; move above 4.15% on hot PCE would pressure equities |

### Risk Factors
1. **Stagflation scenario** from simultaneous GDP miss + hot PCE/GDP deflator — highest probability adverse outcome
2. **Supreme Court tariff ruling** — unscheduled catalyst that could move markets in either direction
3. **OpEx pin risk** — large open interest at round-number strikes creates volatility into the close
4. **U.S.-Iran escalation** — any headline risk from military tensions drives oil and gold higher, equities lower
5. **FOMC speakers (Bostic, Logan)** — could move rate expectations if hawkish on PCE data
