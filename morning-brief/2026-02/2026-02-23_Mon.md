# BigPic Morning Brief

## Event Load: HEAVY — Monday, February 23, 2026

Tariff regime reset dominates: Trump raises global tariffs to 15% after the Supreme Court struck down the prior framework, triggering a broad risk-off open. Gold surges past $5,100, crypto in "extreme fear," VIX pops above 20, and the Magnificent Seven continues to drag indices. NVDA earnings Wednesday is the week's defining event. KTOS and BWXT report before the open today. Fed Governor Waller speaks at 1:00 PM ET.

**Color:** Classic risk-off Monday. Gold screaming higher (+1.80% to fresh highs above $5,100) while equities, crypto, and yields all decline — the market is repricing growth and inflation simultaneously. The VIX jump of +6.44% to 20.32 is the loudest signal: implied vol is resetting for the tariff regime change. The Russell's -0.51% underperformance confirms that the most economically sensitive names are taking the heaviest hit. DXY flat at 97.61 despite risk-off is notable — dollar weakness may reflect the tariff uncertainty cutting both ways (growth drag vs import price inflation).

## Overnight & Global Markets

| Market | Level | Change | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nikkei 225 | 56,826 | -1.12% | schwab |
| Hang Seng | 27,082 | +2.53% | schwab |
| Kospi | 5,846 | -1.34% | stooq |
| DAX | 25,127 | -0.53% | schwab |
| CAC 40 | 8,515 | flat | schwab |
| FTSE 100 | 10,704 | +0.19% | stooq |
| Europe STOXX 50 (FEZ) | 68.88 | +0.26% | schwab |
| Australia (EWA) | 29.75 | +0.17% | schwab |

**Asia Session:** Divergent. Nikkei fell 1.12% and Kospi dropped 1.34% — export-sensitive Asian markets are pricing in the 15% global tariff reset directly. Hang Seng was the standout at +2.53% (flagged anomalous, z-score: 4.1), likely reflecting China leverage positioning ahead of the expected US-China summit. The HSI strength diverges sharply from regional weakness.

**Europe Session:** Modest and mixed. DAX -0.53% as German exporters feel the tariff threat. Europe warns of "pure tariff chaos." CAC flat, FTSE +0.19%. European STOXX 50 ETF (FEZ) +0.26% — Europe holding up better than Asia ex-China, suggesting the tariff impact is perceived as more damaging to Asian supply chains.

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Event | Impact | Consensus | Prior | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13:00 | **FOMC Member Waller Speaks** | **Medium** | — | — | Pending |
| 15:00 | Factory Orders m/m | Low | -0.4% | 2.7% | Pending |

**Light calendar, but Waller is the event.** His speech is titled "Labor Market Data: Signal or Noise?" — previewing that the next jobs report (not the Supreme Court tariff ruling) will determine the March rate decision. Given the FOMC meets March 17-18 (just 3.5 weeks away), any hawkish or dovish lean here moves rate expectations. CME currently prices 60% hold / 38% cut for March. Factory Orders at 3 PM is second-tier — consensus at -0.4% after a strong +2.7% prior.

## Pre-Market Movers

| Symbol | Price | Change | Sector | Watchlist? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NVO** | $40.38 | **-14.85%** | Pharma | No (but major market event) |
| IBRX | $9.42 | +8.28% | Biotech | No |
| $VIX | 20.32 | +6.44% | Vol | — |
| WRAP | $1.80 | +5.26% | — | No |
| LLY | $1,044 | +3.39% | Pharma | No |
| **STEM** | $10.90 | -3.20% | **Energy Storage** | **Tier 3** |

### News-Driven Movers

| Symbol | Direction | Catalyst | Watchlist? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NVO** | Down -15% | CagriSema failed head-to-head vs Eli Lilly's tirzepatide in REDEFINE 4 Phase III obesity trial | No |
| LLY | Up +3.4% | Tirzepatide validated as superior obesity drug — massive wealth transfer from NVO | No |
| **TSLA** | Down | EV sales cratering; sentiment headwind | **Tier 1 Energy Storage** |
| GILD | Up | $7.8B cancer treatment acquisition signals pipeline confidence | No |
| **MSTR** | Down | BTC exposure headwind as crypto slides; added 592 BTC at $39.8M | No |

**Key move:** NVO -15% / LLY +3.4% is the day's biggest single-stock story. CagriSema losing head-to-head to tirzepatide is a $100B+ market cap transfer between the two obesity drug leaders. Not on our watchlist, but the magnitude impacts broad pharma sentiment and S&P 500 composition.

## Market Context & Playbook

**VIX Regime:** Elevated at 20.32, up 6.44% — the sharpest single-session VIX move in weeks. This confirms the market is repricing for the tariff regime change. VIX above 20 with NVDA earnings Wednesday creates a vol-of-vol environment. Expect amplified intraday swings.

**SPY Trend:** Neutral. SPY at 6,910 is flat on the week with SMA200 at 651 (ETF basis). The index is range-bound between 6,850-6,950. A break below 6,850 opens the door to the SMA50 test.

**Today's Bias: Cautious / Lean Bearish.** Rationale:
- Tariff regime reset to 15% creates genuine uncertainty — trade deals at risk, Europe warns of chaos
- VIX +6.44% signals institutional hedging, not just retail fear
- Gold at all-time highs above $5,100 = classic flight to safety
- Mag 7 "Lag 7" narrative gaining traction — AI capex ROI questioned ahead of NVDA
- Crypto in extreme fear ($3.8B ETF outflows in 5 weeks) signals broad risk aversion
- Waller speech could add rate uncertainty if hawkish

**Counterbalance (don't get too bearish):**
- Calendar is light — no major data to force a move
- NVDA Wednesday provides a natural bid for dip-buyers positioning early
- Hang Seng +2.53% suggests China is reading the tariff reset differently
- 10Y yield declining (4.058%) = no bond market panic

**Key Levels:**
- S&P 6,850 = near-term support (below this, sellers gain control)
- S&P 6,950 = near-term resistance (Friday high area)
- VIX 22 = elevated concern threshold; above this suggests more than just tariff repricing
- Gold $5,200 = next psychological resistance; breaking it signals tariff fears are escalating

**Risk Factors:**
1. Tariff retaliation from Europe/Asia — "pure tariff chaos" warning is not priced
2. NVDA guidance miss Wednesday would crater the entire AI stack
3. Waller hawkish surprise on March rate decision
4. Crypto liquidation cascade if BTC loses $64K support

| **Critical Minerals** | Divergent. FCX -0.06% holding near highs (z-score: 4.1), copper supply deficit thesis intact. MP -0.87% below SMA200. Multiple copper project catalysts (BC approves Surge, Faraday targets BHP's San Manuel). | FCX, SCCO, MP, ALB |
