# BigPic Morning Brief

## Event Load: HEAVY — Tuesday, February 17, 2026

**First full trading day after Presidents' Day.** Three watchlist earnings before the open: PANW, LDOS, CEG. Empire State Manufacturing at 8:30 AM ET. Two FOMC speakers (Barr, Daly). Cautious risk-off tone prevails as markets rotate away from AI/tech leadership, with key inflation data and FOMC minutes later this week. VIX jumped 5% to 22.28 — elevated regime with bearish SPY trend.

| Ethereum | $1,971 | -2.12% | CoinGecko |

**Color:** Decidedly risk-off into the first session back from the holiday. Nasdaq futures leading downside at -0.88%, consistent with the UBS downgrade of US tech and the AI rotation narrative. The VIX spike to 22.28 (+5%) signals hedging demand accelerating — firmly in elevated regime. Yields are flat with the 10Y pinned at 4.056%, holding below the 4.1% psychological threshold as Treasury yields move lower ahead of key inflation data. The dollar firming modestly at 97.20. Crude catching a bid (+1.1%) while gold sells off sharply (-1.87%) from above $5,000 — unusual divergence suggesting positioning adjustments rather than macro signal. Bitcoin under pressure near $68K with recession fears weighing; crypto-Nasdaq positive correlation means the tech selloff is dragging digital assets.

## Overnight & Global Markets

| Market | Level | Change | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Nikkei 225 | 56,566 | -0.42% | Schwab |
| Hang Seng | 26,706 | +0.52% | Schwab |
| DAX | 24,796 | -0.02% | Schwab |
| CAC 40 | 8,311 | -0.06% | Schwab |

| Europe STOXX 50 (FEZ) | 67.57 | +0.04% | Schwab |
| Australia (EWA) | 29.22 | +0.21% | Schwab |

**Asia:** Japan weak (-0.42%) reflecting continued GDP disappointment and risk-off spillover. Hong Kong bucked the trend (+0.52%), with Alibaba's Qwen3.5 launch keeping China AI excitement alive. Korea flat.

**Europe:** Essentially unchanged across the board. The STOXX 50 rally from yesterday paused (+0.04%). FTSE modestly green (+0.19%). UK employment data showed rising unemployment and private pay increases slowing to 5-year lows, pulling sterling lower. The European defense buildup narrative continues — MarketWatch flags that Europe's military bond issuance could create a rival to US Treasurys.

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Event | Impact | Details |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| 8:20 AM | ADP Weekly Employment Change | Low | Scheduled — Consensus: N/A, Prior: 6.5K |
| 8:30 AM | Empire State Manufacturing Index | Medium | Scheduled — Consensus: 6.4, Prior: 7.7 |
| 9:48 AM | Cleveland Fed Inflation Expectations | Low | Scheduled — Prior: 3.3% |
| 10:00 AM | NAHB Housing Market Index | Low | Scheduled — Consensus: 38, Prior: 37 |
| 12:45 PM | FOMC Member Barr Speaks | Low | Watch for signals on bank capital framework |
| 2:30 PM | FOMC Member Daly Speaks | Low | San Francisco Fed president — listen for rate path commentary |

The Empire State Manufacturing print at 8:30 AM is the main event on the economic calendar. Consensus at 6.4 vs. prior 7.7 — a miss below zero would add to recession fears that are already weighing on sentiment. The two FOMC speakers (Barr, Daly) are lower-tier but any deviation from the easing posture would matter given the cautious risk environment. The FOMC meeting minutes release is the bigger event later this week.

## Market Context & Playbook

### VIX Regime Assessment
- **VIX:** 22.28 (+5.09%)
- **Regime:** Elevated — expanding, now above 22
- **SPY Trend:** Bearish
- **Risk Appetite:** Cautious

The VIX jumped 5% overnight from 20.60 to 22.28, the sharpest single-day move in recent sessions. This is no longer just "elevated but stable" — volatility is expanding in a bearish SPY trend. The combination of rising VIX + bearish trend + cautious risk appetite signals a defensive posture is warranted. The market is pricing in uncertainty around this week's FOMC minutes, the AI rotation trade, and growing recession fears.

### Today's Bias: Bearish

**Rationale:**
- All four equity futures red, with Nasdaq leading at -0.88% — tech is the target
- VIX expanding +5%, breaching 22 — hedging demand accelerating
- UBS formally downgraded US tech stocks, citing "challenging math"
- S&P 500 falling as "fortunes turn from AI tech firms" per Seeking Alpha
- Gold selling off (-1.87%) alongside crypto (-2.67%) — risk assets and safe havens both under pressure suggests deleveraging
- Software sell-off called "broken logic" by JPM, but the market doesn't care yet
- Three high-stakes watchlist earnings before the open (PANW, LDOS, CEG) create event risk

**Counterbalances:**
- Oil catching a bid (+1.1%) suggests not all risk is off
- Oversold RSI readings across multiple Tier 1 names (ZS 26, ISRG 28, PANW 33) suggest downside is limited in quality
- TSM considering $100B Arizona investment is a constructive semiconductor signal
- Morgan Stanley's 'HALO' trade (hard assets, land, operational) gaining traction suggests a rotation, not a crash
- Treasury yields moving lower, not higher — the bond market is not panicking

### Playbook

1. **Defensive stance today.** The bearish bias with expanding VIX favors patience over aggression. Let the earnings prints from PANW, LDOS, and CEG establish direction before adding risk.

2. **Earnings-driven opportunities:**
   - **PANW** (RSI 33) — A clean beat could trigger a sharp snap-back given extreme oversold conditions. But a miss at these levels could accelerate the cybersecurity de-rating
   - **LDOS** (+4.75% pre-market) — Momentum is strong. A beat confirms defense cyber as the durable spending floor. $46.2B backlog speaks for itself
   - **CEG** (RSI 52, neutral) — Nuclear sentiment is strong but the stock is 12% below SMA200 ($326). Hyperscaler PPA updates are the wildcard

3. **Oversold watchlist — building a shopping list:**
   - ZS (RSI 26), ISRG (28), SQM (31), FLNC (32), PANW (33), IBM (34), IONQ (34) — all Tier 1/2 names at extreme technical levels. If you're building positions, these are the names to scale into on further weakness with defined risk

4. **Overbought caution remains:** CGNX (RSI 89), HON (76), LMT (73), VRT (71) — avoid chasing strength in these names. VRT's blowout earnings may be fully priced

5. **Watch the rotation trade:** Value and hard assets gaining traction (Morgan Stanley HALO trade). European defense bonds threatening US Treasurys. The "great rotation" from US tech to international/value may be accelerating

### Key Levels to Watch
- **S&P 500:** Previous close 6,836. Futures at 6,819 (-0.46%). A break below 6,800 would be technically significant
- **Nasdaq 100:** Futures at 24,585 (-0.88%). Tech-heavy selling; watch for support at the 25-day moving average
- **VIX 22.28:** A close above 22 confirms elevated regime expansion. A move toward 25 would signal a more meaningful risk-off event
- **NVDA $172:** 200-day SMA. Must hold for AI infrastructure thesis. NVDA earnings on Feb 25 is the next major test
- **BTC $67,836:** Below last weekend's $68K low. Next support is in the $63-65K range. Recession fears + Nasdaq correlation dragging crypto
- **10Y Yield 4.056%:** Stable. A move below 4.0% would be bullish for growth/duration; above 4.1% would add pressure
- **Gold $4,952:** Sharp -1.87% drop below $5,000. If this is profit-taking, recovery is likely. If deleveraging, watch for further downside

### Risk Factors
- **FOMC minutes later this week** — any hawkish surprise on rate cut pace would hit rate-sensitive sectors hard in this fragile environment
- **AI rotation accelerating** — UBS downgrade of US tech, JPM calling software sell-off "broken logic," Deutsche Bank tracing AI loser selloff to 2022 — institutional narrative shifting
- **Recession fears building** — BofA survey flags dollar bearish bets at decade-high, Bitcoin under pressure on recession positioning, value rotation gaining momentum
- **Three earnings before the open** — PANW, LDOS, CEG create concentrated event risk. A miss from any of these could drag their respective sectors
- **Crypto fragility** — BTC below $68K, now at $67.8K. Extreme bearish call of $10K from McGlone adds to negative sentiment. Institutional adoption (Intesa Sanpaolo $100M BTC ETF) provides a floor
- **TSMC tariff dynamics** — The $100B Arizona consideration is positive but highlights the policy uncertainty driving corporate decisions. Tariff escalation risk persists

## Sector Snapshot

| Sector | Key Moves | One-Line Summary |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **AI Infrastructure** | TSM -1.74%, NVDA -0.67%, VRT -1.14% | Broad weakness as UBS downgrades US tech. TSM $100B Arizona consideration is bullish medium-term but sector under rotation pressure today. VRT blowout earnings may cushion. |
| **Cybersecurity** | LDOS +4.75%, PANW -0.57%, CRWD -1.43%, ZS -0.69% | Split session — LDOS surging into earnings, rest of sector soft. PANW and CEG earnings are today's event. ZS at RSI 26 is the most oversold name in the watchlist. |
| **Nuclear Energy** | CEG -0.05%, VST -1.13%, LEU -1.27%, CCJ -0.74% | Gave back yesterday's gains. CEG earnings today is the event. Palisades restart, Part 53 rule, and hyperscaler PPA flow remain near-term catalysts. |
| **Quantum Computing** | IONQ -0.82%, HON -0.31%, IBM -0.87%, RGTI -2.49% | Cooling after yesterday's Majorana-driven rally. Research advances (gold-based materials, carbon nanotube breakthroughs) keep the sector in headlines. Quantinuum IPO watch. |
| **Defense & Aerospace** | LMT +0.19%, NOC +0.37%, RTX +0.24%, LHX +0.02% | Steady. Primes grinding higher in a risk-off tape — classic defensive rotation. Europe's military buildup narrative creating "bond market powerhouse" per MarketWatch. LMT overbought at RSI 73. |
| **Space** | LUNR -2.60%, RKLB -0.93%, PL -1.74% | Pulling back after yesterday's rally. Artemis II (Mar 6) approaching. Leonardo funding EO constellation. Space nuclear power identified as key bottleneck. |
| **Energy Storage** | FLNC -1.90%, TSLA -1.04%, SQM -1.24%, ALB -1.30% | Broad weakness. 2GWh Ukraine partnership (KNESS/Hithium) and Caterpillar VC backing LFP factory in Serbia are positive, but UK planning barriers threaten storage momentum. |
| **Critical Minerals** | FCX -1.10%, MP -0.86%, LYSCF flat | Quiet. Active exploration and M&A across copper, gold, uranium. Niger-Mali adjusting mining relationships. Fortescue deploying battery trains in Australia. FCX Grasberg Q2 restart on track. |
| **Robotics & Automation** | CGNX +0.37%, ISRG -0.09%, SYM -1.18% | CGNX remains extremely overbought (RSI 89). ISRG at RSI 28 is the key oversold opportunity. Sector quiet — motor design and cobot workspace design dominating news flow. |
