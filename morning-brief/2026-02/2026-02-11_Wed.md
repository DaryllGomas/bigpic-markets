## Today's Playbook

**Bias: Volatile — Data-Driven Reversal Day.** The January NFP surprise (+130K vs +55K) initially launched equities to near all-time highs, then reversed as yields surged and software stocks cratered -3.5%. The S&P 500 failed at highs — that reversal is the session's tell. Powell's House testimony Day 2 will be parsed for real-time reaction to the jobs surprise. VRT's blowout validates AI infrastructure capex, while ALB and CSCO after close extend the earnings narrative.

**Watch For:**
- **VRT breakout follow-through** — $15B backlog and +252% order growth is extraordinary. Gap-up to ~$229 with new analyst targets at $260-280. First support test at $200-210 gap-fill zone. Read-through: ETN, PWR for AI power/cooling.
- **Powell's House testimony** — "No urgency to cut" reinforced by strong jobs data. Watch for any shift in tone given the 130K print. Rate expectations now July for next cut.
- **ALB after close** — lithium bellwether. Kings Mountain restart timeline and 2026 lithium price guidance set direction for ALB, SQM, LAC, FLNC, EOSE. Expected loss of -$0.49 to -$0.62.
- **CSCO after close** — networking spend data relevant to ANET (Tier 1). Street expects $15.0-15.2B revenue.
- **NXE CNSC hearing** (running through Feb 13) — most important near-term uranium catalyst. Greenlights largest new uranium mine.
- **Software sector selloff** (-3.5%) — PANW -1.5%, CRWD soft. No stock-specific news; sector rotation on strong jobs data. Potential entry points if conviction high.

**Risks:**
- S&P 500 reversal from near-ATH is bearish signal — yields surging reduces appetite for high-multiple growth
- "Good news is bad news" regime: strong labor market → fewer rate cuts → headwind for duration-sensitive names (IONQ, RKLB, OKLO)
- Software selloff could deepen if Powell reinforces hawkish posture
- VRT's massive gap-up creates gap-fill risk if broader market deteriorates
- API crude inventory build (+13.4M barrels) is the largest since Nov 2023 — potential oil headwind
- Crypto selloff continues (BTC $66K, -47% from peak) — risk appetite indicator

**Sector Impact:**

| Sector | Impact | Key Driver |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| AI Infrastructure | Mixed to Positive | VRT blowout validates thesis; higher rates pressure multiples |
| Nuclear | Mixed | Strong economy supports hyperscaler capex; higher yields pressure utility valuations |
| Defense | Insulated | Budget cycle and backlogs drive; unaffected by macro |
| Cybersecurity | Positive (longer-term) | NET +7% validates spending; software selloff may create entry points |
| Critical Minerals | Positive | Gold $5,061 benefits PPTA; ALB earnings tonight set lithium direction |
| Quantum | Negative | Rate-sensitive pre-revenue names vulnerable to yield backup |
| Robotics | Modestly Positive | LSCC +11% positive for automation recovery cycle |
| Energy Storage | Mixed | Ford hybrid pivot working; EV ecosystem mixed signals. ALB tonight key. |
| Space | Neutral | No specific movers. Artemis II (Mar 6) and SpaceX IPO (mid-2026) upcoming |
