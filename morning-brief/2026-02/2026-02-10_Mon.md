## Scenario Analysis (HEAVY WEEK)

### NFP Tuesday — Three Scenarios

| Scenario | NFP Print | Market Reaction | Rate Implications |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Soft** | <40K | Risk-off initially, then rally on rate cut acceleration | June cut locked in, May becomes live |
| **Goldilocks** | 50-80K | Mildly positive, confirms soft landing | June remains base case for first cut |
| **Hot** | >100K | Hawkish repricing, yields up, equities mixed | June cut probability drops, pushed to Sept |

### CPI Thursday — Two Scenarios

| Scenario | Signal | Market Reaction |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Disinflation resumes** | Core CPI <0.2% MoM | Rally: validates Jefferson's "stalled but temporary" framing. Rate cuts accelerated |
| **Sticky inflation** | Core CPI >0.3% MoM | Selloff: challenges the entire 2026 easing narrative. 10Y back toward 4.30%+ |

## Today's Playbook

**Bias:** Cautiously bullish into Tuesday's NFP. Friday's momentum carries over. Monday's data is low-impact.

**Watch for:**
- NexGen CNSC hearing opens today in Saskatoon — any early signals on regulatory sentiment
- Weekend crypto stability — BTC holding $65-70K range would confirm Thursday was the flush
- Iran developments — Polymarket odds, diplomatic signals from Oman talks
- Pre-market activity in VRT/ANET ahead of Tuesday/Thursday reports

**Risk to manage:**
- Don't chase Friday's rally too aggressively ahead of NFP/CPI wall
- CEG dip may be opportunity but wait for Feb 19 earnings clarity on Calpine
- BTC bounce fragile — funding rates still positive, more longs to liquidate if $65K breaks
