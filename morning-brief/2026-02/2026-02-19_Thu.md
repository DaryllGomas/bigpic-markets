# BigPic Morning Brief

## Event Load: HEAVY — Thursday, February 19

Risk-off tone intensifies as hawkish FOMC minutes rattled markets overnight — Fed officials discussed a possible rate hike, sending Bitcoin into its longest losing streak since 2022 and pulling futures lower. U.S.-Iran tensions are driving oil to six-month highs. Walmart's weak forward guidance adds to the fragile macro backdrop. Thirteen economic releases hit today, headlined by weekly unemployment claims (8:30 AM ET) and three Fed speakers. Gold breached $5,000 on safe-haven demand. The pre-market narrative is defensive: cash and commodities over equities and crypto.

**Color:** Futures are uniformly red, with Nasdaq leading lower (-0.34%) as the hawkish FOMC minutes weigh on growth/duration assets. VIX is back above 20 and climbing (+2.80%), confirming the elevated regime. The 10Y at 4.079% is flat despite the hawkish tone — the bond market may be pricing in slower growth rather than more hikes. Oil is the standout: WTI at $66.10 (+1.61%) and Brent at $71.37 (+1.45%) on U.S.-Iran tensions and Russia-Iran naval drills, with Brent hitting a six-month high. Gold at $5,002 held above the $5K psychological level on safe-haven flows. Crypto is bleeding: Bitcoin at $66,324 (-1.76%) logging its longest losing streak since 2022, with ETF outflows across BTC/ETH/XRP. The 2s/10s spread at +64.9 bps remains positive — no inversion signal, but the risk-off posture is clear. DXY at 97.90 (+0.28%) firming modestly as dollar demand picks up.

## Overnight & Global Markets

| Market | Level | Change | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Nikkei 225 | 57,468 | +0.57% | schwab |
| Hang Seng | 26,706 | +0.52% | schwab |
| DAX | 25,058 | -0.87% | schwab |

| Europe Broad (IEV) | 74.15 | +0.98% | schwab |
| Australia (EWA) | 29.72 | +1.40% | schwab |

**Asia:** Resilient overnight session. Nikkei +0.57% and Hang Seng +0.52% held gains despite the hawkish Fed signal, likely on local tech strength. Kospi was the standout at +0.62%. Australia rallied +1.40%, driven by commodity strength and resource sector exposure to the gold/oil bid.

**Europe:** The reverse story — DAX -0.87% and CAC -0.83% selling off as the FOMC minutes hit during the European session. FTSE -0.62%. Airbus -6% (targeting only 870 deliveries for the year amid engine supply issues) weighed on European aerospace. The SCAF sixth-gen fighter program was declared "dead," potentially reshuffling European defense procurement toward U.S. primes. Note: ETF-based European indices (FEZ +0.78%, IEV +0.98%) diverge from cash indices due to timing/NAV effects.

## Today's Calendar

| **8:30 AM** | **Unemployment Claims** | **HIGH** | **223K** | **227K** | **Pending** |

| 8:30 AM | Goods Trade Balance | Low | -$86.0B | -$86.9B | Pending |
| 8:30 AM | Prelim Wholesale Inventories m/m | Low | 0.2% | 0.2% | Pending |
| 8:30 AM | Trade Balance | Low | -$55.5B | -$56.8B | Pending |
| 9:00 AM | FOMC Member Kashkari Speaks | Low | — | — | Pending |
| 10:00 AM | Pending Home Sales m/m | Medium | 1.4% | -9.3% | Pending |
| 10:00 AM | CB Leading Index m/m | Low | -0.2% | -0.3% | Pending |
| 10:30 AM | FOMC Member Goolsbee Speaks | Low | — | — | Pending |
| 10:30 AM | Natural Gas Storage | Low | -148B | -249B | Pending |
| 12:00 PM | Crude Oil Inventories | Low | 1.7M | 8.5M | Pending |

**Key focus:** Three things matter today. (1) **Unemployment Claims at 8:30 AM** — consensus 223K vs. prior 227K. A tick higher would reinforce the "slowing labor market" narrative and could ease some of the rate hike anxiety from the minutes. A surprise drop below 220K would support the hawkish case. (2) **Philly Fed Manufacturing at 8:30 AM** — consensus 7.5 vs. prior 12.6. A significant miss here would signal manufacturing weakening and add to recession watch. (3) **Three Fed speakers** (Bostic, Bowman, Kashkari, Goolsbee) — markets will parse whether any officials push back on the rate hike discussion from the minutes. Any dovish dissent could provide relief. Pending Home Sales at 10:00 AM (consensus +1.4% vs. prior -9.3%) is a potential positive if the rebound materializes. Crude oil inventories at noon — watch for a potential draw to support the oil rally, though consensus expects a 1.7M build vs. prior 8.5M.

**News-driven context:** WMT is down pre-market — strong holiday sales but forward earnings outlook fell short. PLTR is under pressure as Michael Burry reportedly shorting and the stock has dropped a third from its peak. NVDA sold off its final ARM shares and faces broader AI ROI questioning. SMCI got a rating upgrade on margin expansion expectations. RIOT jumped ~9% after activist Starboard urged AI data center expansion.

## Thesis Watchlist Update

### Earnings Reporting Today
No watchlist earnings reporting today.

### Upcoming Watchlist Earnings (Next 7 Days)

| Symbol | Sector | Date | Time |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| **CEG** | Nuclear Energy (Tier 1) | Feb 24 (Mon) | Before Open |
| **NVDA** | AI Infrastructure (Tier 1) | Feb 25 (Tue) | Before Open |
| **RKLB** | Space (Tier 2) | Feb 26 (Wed) | Before Open |
| **ZS** | Cybersecurity (Tier 1) | Feb 26 (Wed) | Before Open |
| **VST** | Nuclear Energy (Tier 1) | Feb 26 (Wed) | Before Open |
| **MP** | Critical Minerals (Tier 1) | Feb 26 (Wed) | Before Open |
| **LYSCF** | Critical Minerals (Tier 1) | Feb 26 (Wed) | Before Open |

Next week is the most important earnings week of the quarter for the watchlist. NVDA (Feb 25) is the headline event — the market will parse data center revenue growth trajectory and Rubin architecture commentary. CEG (Feb 24) reports first amid nuclear utility repricing narrative. The Feb 26 cluster (RKLB, ZS, VST, MP, LYSCF) spans four sectors.

### Notable Tier 1 Moves & RSI Extremes

| Symbol | Sector | Price | Change | RSI | Signal |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-----|--------|
| **FLNC** | Energy Storage | $17.65 | +1.26% | **17** | Deeply oversold — 57% below SMA50 ($23.00) |
| **ZS** | Cybersecurity | $173 | +0.58% | **20** | Deeply oversold — 18% below SMA50 ($212) |
| **LEU** | Nuclear Energy | $206 | -0.11% | **26** | Oversold — sitting right on SMA200 ($206) |
| **PANW** | Cybersecurity | $153 | +0.43% | **26** | Oversold — 21% below SMA200 ($193) |
| **IONQ** | Quantum Computing | $33.27 | -0.21% | **28** | Oversold — 30% below SMA200 ($47.42) |
| **CGNX** | Robotics | $55.70 | -1.80% | **83** | Overbought — 44% above SMA200 ($38.71) |
| **HON** | Quantum Computing | $241 | -0.12% | **83** | Overbought — 16% above SMA200 ($207) |
| **VRT** | AI Infrastructure | $247 | +1.44% | **70** | Near overbought — 63% above SMA200 ($151) |

**Key observations:** The cybersecurity sector is deeply oversold across multiple Tier 1 names (ZS RSI 20, PANW RSI 26, CRWD RSI 34, CACI RSI 31). This clustering suggests sector-wide selling pressure rather than company-specific issues — potential mean-reversion setup ahead of ZS earnings Feb 26. FLNC (RSI 17) is the most oversold name on the entire watchlist with a $5.5B backlog and 48% revenue growth guidance — the disconnect between fundamentals and price action is extreme. LEU sitting exactly on its SMA200 ($206) is a critical inflection point. On the overbought side, CGNX (RSI 83) and HON (RSI 83) are stretched; both could pull back.

## Market Context & Playbook

### VIX Regime Assessment
- **VIX:** 20.28 — elevated regime, above the 20 threshold
- **Trend:** Rising (+2.80% today) — fear increasing on FOMC hawkishness and geopolitical risks
- **Context:** VIX has been pushing higher all week. Elevated VIX with rising oil, falling crypto, and Fed rate hike talk is a classic risk-off cocktail

### Today's Bias: BEARISH with Caution

**Rationale:**
1. **FOMC minutes overhang** — the rate hike discussion is a narrative shift. Markets had priced in rate *cuts*, not potential hikes. The repricing is incomplete.
2. **Oil geopolitical premium** — U.S.-Iran tensions with Russia-Iran naval drills are pushing crude to six-month highs. Rising energy costs add to the stagflation narrative.
3. **WMT guidance miss** — the consumer bellwether signaling softer earnings ahead is a macro warning.
4. **Bitcoin losing streak since 2022** — risk appetite is collapsing in the speculative end of markets. ETF outflows across BTC/ETH/XRP confirm institutional rotation out of risk.
5. **Powell exit uncertainty** — Powell departing in May with a split Fed creates a leadership vacuum. MarketWatch warns of "one final sting" before the transition.

**Counterbalances:**
- Pockets of tech strength: Cadence (+7% yesterday), DoorDash (+14%), Figma deal — indicating AI/software demand persists beneath the macro headwinds
- Gold above $5,000 — safe-haven bid is strong and could support mining/commodity names on the watchlist
- Three Fed speakers today — any dovish pushback on rate hike talk could trigger a relief rally

### Key Levels to Watch
- **S&P 500:** 6,880 futures (S&P cash closed 6,881 flat yesterday). Yesterday's close was described as "hitting resistance" — a break below 6,850 would target the SMA50 area
- **VIX:** Watch 21.0 — a sustained move above 21 would signal further risk-off escalation and potential for systematic selling
- **10Y Yield:** 4.079% — holding flat despite hawkish minutes. If 10Y breaks above 4.10%, expect equity pressure to intensify
- **WTI Crude:** $66.10 — a sustained push above $67 could trigger inflation fear trade and accelerate equity selling
- **Gold:** $5,000 psychological level — held today. A break higher toward $5,050 confirms safe-haven rotation

### Risk Factors
1. **Fed speakers could amplify or dampen hawkish narrative** — the highest-impact variable today
2. **Unemployment claims surprise** — a hot labor print (below 218K) would reinforce the hike narrative; a weak one (above 230K) could shift focus to slowdown
3. **Oil escalation** — any headlines about U.S.-Iran military confrontation would spike crude and VIX simultaneously
4. **Pre-earnings positioning** — NVDA reports Tuesday. Institutional hedging ahead of the most important single-stock earnings event could add selling pressure
