**Color:** Futures are near flat following yesterday's unchanged session. The VIX at 17.75 is drifting lower (-1.00%) but still above the sub-15 complacency zone — normal regime. Yields are pinned: the 10Y at 4.048% is barely moving, and the 2s/10s curve remains positively sloped at +62 bps. Oil is the notable mover — WTI down over 2% to $64.07, extending weakness as Iran nuclear talks restart amid record Iranian oil exports. Gold giving back a half percent at $5,199. Crypto is the bright spot: Bitcoin reclaimed $68K (+3.08%) and ETH rallied nearly 6%, with altcoins (DOT +17%, UNI +15%) leading the strongest bounce in weeks. DXY flat at 97.59.

| Australia (EWA) | 30.17 | +0.03% | Schwab |

**Asia session:** Mixed overnight. Hang Seng was the laggard at -1.44%, digesting ongoing China tech regulatory concerns. Kospi was the standout with a +3.04% surge — worth monitoring for Samsung/SK Hynix semiconductor sentiment. Nikkei drifted modestly higher (+0.29%).

**Europe session:** Continental Europe green across the board — CAC 40 led at +0.92%, DAX +0.42%, FTSE +0.26%. Rolls-Royce ($RYCEY +4.67%) was a major contributor after raising guidance and announcing up to $12B in buybacks on strong engine demand. European defense and industrial names continue to benefit from the rearmament narrative.

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Event | Impact | Consensus | Prior | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 13:30 | Unemployment Claims | HIGH | 217K | 206K | Pending |
| 15:00 | FOMC Member Bowman Speaks | LOW | — | — | Pending |
| 15:30 | Natural Gas Storage | LOW | -36B | -144B | Pending |

**Key event:** Weekly claims at 13:30 ET. Consensus 217K vs. prior 206K. A significant beat or miss could move rate expectations, especially ahead of the March 17-18 FOMC meeting (first 2026 dot plot, CME pricing: 60% hold / 38% cut). Bowman's remarks at 15:00 are low-impact unless she deviates from recent hawkish signals. Nat gas storage draw expected at -36B, a significant narrowing from last week's -144B draw.

## Market Context & Playbook

### VIX Regime Assessment
- **VIX Level:** 17.75 (down 1.00%)
- **Regime:** Normal. VIX is below 20 but above the 15 complacency zone. The -3.3 z-score anomaly flag suggests this is lower than typical for the current environment.
- **Trend:** Drifting lower. Consistent with a market that is digesting rather than panicking, but not yet in full risk-on mode.

### Today's Bias: NEUTRAL with cautious undertone

**Rationale:**
1. **NVIDIA's muted response is the key signal.** Record $215B annual revenue, beat on Q4, and delivered first Vera Rubin samples — yet gains are marginal. This mirrors the "buy the rumor, sell the news" fatigue pattern in mega-cap AI. The market is not rewarding even blowout results at current valuations.
2. **Futures are flat** despite a massive earnings slate. The market is waiting for today's 8 watchlist reports to set direction.
3. **Oil weakness (-2%)** suggests macro growth concerns are creeping in, even as Iran nuclear talks introduce supply dynamics.
4. **Crypto strength (+3-6%)** is a risk appetite indicator, but it's disconnected from equity index behavior — more of an altcoin-specific rally than broad risk-on.
5. **Claims data at 13:30** is the swing factor. A miss (higher claims) could reignite rate cut hopes; a strong print could extend the "higher for longer" narrative.

### Key Levels to Watch
- **S&P 500 Futures:** 6,963 — essentially flat. Cash S&P at 6,946 (prev close). SMA200 on SPY at $653 ($6,530 equivalent) is well below — not a concern. The index is flagged with a z-score of 3.2, meaning it's at historically elevated levels.
- **Nasdaq 100 Futures:** 25,375 — fractionally red. The tech-heavy index is the one to watch given NVDA reaction and today's ZS/ESTC earnings.
- **VIX 17.75:** Below 20 is constructive. A move above 20 on earnings misses would signal regime shift.
- **10Y at 4.048%:** Pinned. A break above 4.10% or below 4.00% on claims data would have equity implications.
- **WTI $64.07:** Approaching the $62-63 support zone. A break lower would signal demand concerns.

### Risk Factors
1. **Earnings concentration risk:** 8 watchlist names reporting today. Bad results from ZS or RKLB could cascade across cybersecurity and space sectors.
2. **NVIDIA muted response spillover:** If even blowout AI earnings can't lift the market, what can? Sentiment risk for the broader AI trade.
3. **Oil weakness:** WTI -2% suggests either macro demand concerns or Iran supply expectations. Watch for follow-through.
4. **Tariff uncertainty:** Supreme Court ruling upending tariff authority creates trade deal uncertainty per today's headlines.
5. **Geopolitical:** Hungary-Ukraine energy tensions, Iran nuclear talks, Russia-Cuba escalation — multiple background risks.
6. **March FOMC convergence:** We are 3 weeks from the first 2026 dot plot (Mar 18), which overlaps with Triple Witch (Mar 20). Positioning starts Mar 9. Strategic window.

## Sector Snapshot

| Sector | Tier 1 Moves | One-Line Summary |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **AI Infrastructure** | NVDA +1.20%, TSM +0.68%, VRT +0.35%, AVGO -0.30%, ANET -0.29% | NVIDIA's record quarter validates AI spend but muted stock response reflects valuation fatigue; VRT overbought at RSI 77. |
| **Cybersecurity** | CRWD -0.32%, PANW +0.19%, ZS +0.43%, FTNT -0.26% | Deeply oversold across the sector (PANW RSI 29, ZS RSI 32, CRWD RSI 34). ZS/ESTC earnings today are make-or-break. |
| **Nuclear Energy** | CEG +0.17%, CCJ -0.14%, VST +1.71%, LEU -0.04% | VST leads ahead of earnings; CEG testing SMA200 ($328). Three nuclear names (VST, TLN, UUUU) reporting today tests the hyperscaler PPA thesis. |
| **Critical Minerals** | FCX -0.07%, ALB -1.29%, MP +1.18%, LYSCF +3.60% | LYSCF pops pre-earnings. US aluminum smelter announcement (CENX) signals reshoring acceleration. Rare earth shortages persist per chipmaker reports. |
| **Defense & Aerospace** | LMT -0.36%, RTX +0.03%, NOC +0.33%, LHX +0.90% | Quiet day for primes. Space Force Vulcan pause is notable for RKLB (reporting today). Army 155mm production lag at Mesquite is a headwind for GD. |
| **Quantum Computing** | IONQ +15.12%, QBTS +5.39%, HON -0.08%, IBM +0.63% | IONQ's $100M revenue milestone is a sector-defining moment — first pure-play quantum company at this scale. PQC adoption accelerating (Keeper + QuSecure MDA SHIELD). |
| **Energy Storage** | TSLA -0.56%, FLNC -1.71%, SQM -1.97%, ALB -1.29% | Form Energy/Google 30GWh iron-air battery deal is a long-duration storage milestone. Philippines mandating storage for renewables. FLNC oversold at RSI 34 despite $5.5B backlog. |
| **Robotics & Automation** | ISRG +0.14%, SYK flat, SYM +0.73%, CGNX +0.79% | Alphabet folds Intrinsic robotics back into Google for "physical AI." Wayve raises $1.2B from NVIDIA/Microsoft/Uber. Quiet for public names. |
| **Space** | RKLB +0.97%, PL -1.26%, LUNR +1.45%, RDW -7.08% | RKLB earnings today are the main event. Space Force Vulcan launch pause creates near-term uncertainty. RDW's -7% drop extends selloff. |
