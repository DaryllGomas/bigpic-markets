# Morning Brief -- Markets Research
**Tuesday, February 10, 2026**

## Event Load Rating

**LIGHT-TO-MEDIUM** -- No major macro releases today (CPI, NFP, FOMC all off-calendar). NFIB Small Business Optimism was the lone data point this morning (already released at 6:00 AM ET). Earnings from BDX (beat), ON Semi, and Halliburton are secondary movers. The bigger overhang is MCD reporting Wednesday pre-market and the delayed January jobs report (expected Wednesday) due to the partial government shutdown. Markets are in a holding pattern ahead of that data cluster. The ongoing crypto crash and tariff uncertainty add background noise but no single catalyst dominates today.

US equity futures are modestly higher across the board, with the Russell 2000 outperforming (+0.38%), suggesting some risk-on tilt in small caps. Futures are muted ahead of a light data day, with the market digesting last week's volatility and positioning for Wednesday's delayed jobs report and MCD earnings.

### Asia Recap

| Index | Close | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Nikkei 225 | 57,650.54 | +2.28% (record close) |
| Topix | 3,855.28 | +1.90% (record close) |
| Hang Seng | 27,183.15 | +0.58% |

**Key Developments:**
- **Japan surged to record highs.** The Nikkei 225 rallied 2.28% to an all-time closing high of 57,650, riding the "Takaichi trade" following PM Sanae Takaichi's landslide Lower House victory. The Topix also closed at a record.
- **SoftBank spiked +10.7%** after its subsidiary upgraded full-year forecasts -- relevant for our robotics thesis (SoftBank's $5.375B ABB Robotics acquisition) and AI infra thesis.
- **Hong Kong modestly higher** (+0.58%), Shanghai essentially flat. China remains range-bound ahead of further clarity on stimulus measures and US-China trade dynamics.
- **India opened green** on strong global cues (Sensex, Nifty in the green).

### Europe Session (Still Trading at Time of Writing)

| Index | Level | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| STOXX 600 | ~621+ | ~+0.7% (est.) |
| DAX (Germany) | ~25,015+ | ~+1.2% (est.) |
| FTSE 100 (UK) | ~10,386+ | ~+0.2% (est.) |

European markets are trading higher, led by the DAX. European defense stocks remain well-bid as NATO rearmament continues. The euro is firm against the dollar (EUR/USD ~1.19), reflecting ongoing dollar weakness. Markets positioned ahead of further earnings and economic data.

## Yields & Currency

| Instrument | Level | Change |
|------------|-------|--------|
| US 10-Year | ~4.22% | Steady |
| US 2-Year | ~3.50% | Steady |
| US 30-Year | ~4.85% | Steady |
| 2s/10s Spread | ~+72 bps | Positive (steepening) |
| DXY Dollar Index | 96.84 | -0.03% (near 97) |
| EUR/USD | 1.1901 | -0.09% (euro strong) |
| USD/JPY | 155.26 | Yen strengthening |

**Key Observations:**
- **Yields flat** ahead of delayed economic data. The 10Y holds at ~4.22%, well below the October 2025 highs. Markets are pricing in further Fed easing with the dollar under sustained pressure.
- **DXY down to ~97** -- the dollar has weakened 10.3% over the past 12 months and 2.0% in the past month. Weak labor data and concerns about tariff drag on growth are driving the greenback lower.
- **Yen firming** to 155.26 amid intervention fears following Japan's election results and BoJ policy normalization expectations.
- **Euro at 1.19** -- up 14.9% over the past year, reflecting relative economic resilience in Europe and dollar sell-off. The "sell America" / TACO trade narrative remains active.
- **2s/10s spread positive at ~72bps** -- steepening curve signals growth expectations remain intact but markets expect more short-end cuts.

## Commodities

| Commodity | Level | Change |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| WTI Crude | $64.17-64.32/bbl | +0.97% |
| Brent Crude | ~$68.00/bbl | +0.5% |
| Gold (Spot) | ~$5,039-5,070/oz | +2.0% |
| Silver (Spot) | ~$82.65/oz | +5.0% |
| Natural Gas | $3.14/MMBtu | -8.2% |
| Copper | $5.91/lb | -0.94% |

**Key Observations:**
- **Gold surged above $5,000** again, rising ~2% to ~$5,070 on softer real yields, weaker USD, and renewed safe-haven demand. Gold continues its remarkable 2025-2026 rally as central bank buying and geopolitical uncertainty persist. This is bullish backdrop for our critical minerals thesis (MP, ALB, FCX benefit from broader metals sentiment).
- **Silver rebounding sharply (+5%)** to ~$82.65/oz after the dramatic January selloff from record $121. Silver erased all 2026 gains in the late-January margin-call-driven crash before stabilizing.
- **Oil modestly higher** -- WTI above $64 and Brent near $68. Markets weighing US-Iran negotiations and uncertainty around Indian oil imports from Russia following trade deal announcements. Oil remains range-bound as OPEC+ production discipline offsets demand concerns.
- **Natural gas plunged -8.2%** to $3.14 as mid-February weather forecasts shifted warmer, particularly across the Northeast, cutting expected heating demand.
- **Copper slipped modestly** (-0.94%) to $5.91/lb despite structural deficit thesis. Supports the long-term bull case for FCX and SCCO but near-term is demand-sensitive.

## Crypto

| Asset | Price | 24h Change |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Bitcoin (BTC) | ~$69,093 | -3.1% |
| Ethereum (ETH) | ~$2,010 | -2.7% |

**Key Observations:**
- **Bitcoin remains under severe pressure**, down ~3% and struggling to hold $70K after a brutal early-February selloff that saw BTC crash from $80K+ to briefly below $61K (the worst drawdown since FTX). Institutional sellers are now net distributors per CryptoQuant. BTC has fallen in 7 of the last 8 sessions.
- **Ethereum at ~$2,010** -- down 2.7% and trading near levels not seen since late 2024. The 52-week range of $1,388-$4,956 shows the severity of the drawdown from highs.
- **Context:** The crypto selloff correlates with the broader risk-off move (Nasdaq weakness, tariff concerns, global liquidity contraction). The quantum computing thesis notes ~$718B in Bitcoin held in quantum-vulnerable addresses (P2PK) as a long-term overhang.
- **Our thesis watchlist exposure:** Crypto weakness has minimal direct impact on our sector watchlists, but it reflects risk appetite broadly. PLTR, TSLA, and other high-beta names in our watchlists tend to correlate with crypto sentiment.

## Fed Speakers

**No major Fed speeches scheduled for today (February 10, 2026).**

**Background Context:**
- The Fed remains in a politically charged environment. The DOJ served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas related to Chair Powell's Senate Banking Committee testimony from June 2025, though Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott publicly stated he doesn't believe Powell committed any crime.
- Senate Democrats are urging a hold on Kevin Warsh's confirmation hearing for Fed Chair until the Powell investigation is resolved.
- Markets are pricing in further rate cuts with the Fed Funds rate expected to move lower in 2026. The weaker dollar and soft economic data reinforce easing expectations.
- **Next FOMC Meeting:** March 17-18, 2026.

## Pre-Market Movers & Sector Watchlist Notes

### Notable Individual Moves
- **Under Armour (UAA):** Tumbling pre-market after Citi downgraded to Sell from Neutral.
- **SoftBank (9984.T / SFTBY):** +10.7% in Tokyo on upgraded forecasts -- positive read-through for AI and robotics thesis names.
- **BDX:** Modestly positive after earnings beat.

### Sector Watchlist Cross-Reference

**From our 9 sector thesis files, here are the tickers and themes to watch today:**

**AI Infrastructure:** NVDA, TSM, AVGO, VRT, ANET, MRVL, MU, ETN, PLTR, GLW, CRWV, AMD, INTC, PWR, CIEN, NOW -- SoftBank's subsidiary forecast upgrade is a positive datapoint for AI infra spending. ON Semiconductor earnings today may provide color on auto/industrial chip demand relevant to the AI/EV supply chain.

**Critical Minerals:** MP, FCX, ALB, SQM, SCCO, UUUU, LAC, PPTA -- Gold above $5K and silver rebounding are positive sentiment for metals broadly. Copper at $5.91/lb supports the structural deficit thesis. Watch lithium prices (spot above $20K/tonne) for ALB/SQM read-through.

**Cybersecurity:** PANW, CRWD, FTNT, ZS, NET, OKTA, LDOS, CACI -- Quiet day for the sector. Google/Wiz EU regulatory verdict was expected around Feb 10 per thesis -- worth monitoring for CNAPP implications.

**Defense:** LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, LHX, PLTR, AVAV, RKLB, KTOS, HII -- European defense stocks remain bid as DAX outperforms. NATO rearmament theme intact. No specific defense catalysts today.

**Energy Storage / Batteries:** ALB, SQM, TSLA, FLNC, EOSE, QS, RIVN, CHPT -- ON Semi earnings relevant (auto/EV chip demand). QuantumScape Eagle Line pilot inauguration expected this month (Feb 2026 per thesis).

**Nuclear:** CEG, VST, CCJ, LEU, TLN, BWXT, NXE, UEC, UUUU, DNN, OKLO, SMR -- NexGen Energy (NXE) CNSC hearing started yesterday (Feb 9-13). This is a key near-term catalyst for uranium miners. Palisades restart also expected Feb-Mar 2026.

**Quantum:** IONQ, QBTS, IBM, HON, NVDA, RGTI, PANW -- No specific catalyst today. Quantinuum IPO filing (S-1 filed Jan 2026) remains the key near-term event.

**Robotics:** ISRG, SYK, SYM, GOOG, CGNX, AUR, HSAI, MBLY, GMED, TSLA, HYMTF, TER -- SoftBank's strong session in Tokyo is a positive for the ABB Robotics acquisition narrative. No specific US robotics catalysts today.

**Space:** PL, RKLB, LUNR, LMT, NOC, LHX, BKSY, RDW -- Artemis II launch scheduled for March 6, 2026 (approaching). SpaceX IPO mid-2026 remains the sector-defining event.

---

## Key Themes for Today

1. **Holding pattern ahead of Wednesday's data dump** -- The delayed January jobs report and December retail sales, combined with MCD earnings, make Wednesday the week's real catalyst day. Today is positioning.

2. **Dollar weakness persists** -- DXY at 97, EUR/USD at 1.19. The 10%+ annual decline in the dollar supports gold (above $5K), international earnings, and commodity prices but reflects deeper concerns about US growth trajectory under tariff regime.

3. **Japan hits records** -- Nikkei and Topix at all-time highs on the Takaichi trade. SoftBank's AI-driven forecast upgrade is a positive signal for the global AI capex cycle.

4. **Crypto carnage continues** -- BTC struggling at $69K after the worst selloff since FTX. Risk appetite indicator is flashing caution, though equity futures are ignoring it for now.

5. **NFIB slight miss** -- Small business optimism at 99.3 (vs 99.8 expected). Uncertainty sub-index rising to 91 reflects tariff and policy unpredictability weighing on small business confidence.

6. **NexGen CNSC hearing underway** -- Critical catalyst for our nuclear/uranium thesis. Feb 9-13 hearing for the Rook I project (largest development-stage uranium mine). Watch NXE, CCJ, UEC, UUUU for any headline impact.
