## Event Load Rating

**HEAVY** -- The rescheduled January nonfarm payrolls report blew past expectations (+130K vs. +55K consensus), triggering a sharp intraday reversal in equities and a surge in Treasury yields. Fed Chair Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee today (Humphrey-Hawkins, Day 2). Multiple Fed speakers (Bowman, Waller, Jefferson, Cook) scheduled. On the earnings front, **Vertiv (VRT) reports pre-market** -- a Tier 1 AI Infrastructure watchlist name -- alongside MCD, TMUS, SHOP, and GFS. After the close, Cisco (CSCO) and AppLovin (APP) report. Gold is above $5,000, crypto is crashing, and the January jobs surprise is reshaping rate-cut expectations for the rest of 2026.

## 1. Overnight Futures & Market Snapshot

US equity futures initially traded flat to slightly lower overnight, then spiked on the 8:30 AM ET January jobs report before reversing sharply.

**Pre-Jobs Data (Overnight):**

| Index | Level | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 (ES) | ~6,935 | -0.05% |
| Nasdaq 100 (NQ) | ~20,550 | -0.22% |
| Dow (YM) | ~50,200 | +0.06% |
| Russell 2000 (RTY) | ~2,564 | +0.06% |

**Post-Jobs Data (8:30 AM+ reaction):**

| Index | Level | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 (ES) | ~6,977 | +0.51% |
| Nasdaq 100 (NQ) | ~20,738 | +0.67% |
| Dow (YM) | ~50,450 | +0.50% |
| Russell 2000 (RTY) | ~2,566 | +0.06% |

**Key dynamic: The rally failed.** S&P 500 futures initially surged ~0.6% on the strong jobs print, briefly putting the index on track for all-time highs. But the advance sputtered as traders digested the implications: fewer rate cuts, surging yields, and a brutal selloff in software stocks (software ETF -3.5%). Most megacaps reversed lower. Money markets shifted the expected next Fed rate cut from **June to July**.

**Tuesday's Close (Feb 10):**
- S&P 500: 6,941.81 (-0.3%) -- briefly topped its all-time high before fading
- Dow: 50,188.14 (+0.1%) -- third consecutive record close
- Nasdaq: 23,102.47 (-0.6%) -- tech underperformance continued

## 2. Asia Recap

Asian markets were broadly positive overnight, led by a surging Japan.

| Index | Close | Change | Driver |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| Nikkei 225 | **CLOSED** | -- | National Foundation Day holiday. Closed Tues at record 57,651 (+2.3%) |
| Hang Seng | 27,266 | +0.3% | Modest gains despite soft China CPI |
| Shanghai / CSI 300 | 4,140 | +0.3% | Shrugged off CPI miss |
| Kospi | 5,346 | +1.0% | Extended recent gains |
| ASX 200 | 9,015 | +1.5% | Strong session |
| Taiwan TAIEX | -- | +1.7% | Semiconductor strength |

**Key Developments:**

- **China CPI miss:** January CPI +0.2% YoY (vs. +0.4% consensus, down from +0.8% in December). PPI -1.4% YoY (slightly better than -1.5% expected). Food prices -0.7% YoY. Persistent deflation concerns linger. Shanghai and Hong Kong largely shrugged off the data, suggesting stimulus expectations remain a floor.

- **Japan closed for National Foundation Day** but closed at record highs Tuesday (Nikkei 57,651, +2.3%) on the "Takaichi trade" after PM Takaichi's landslide LDP victory. Yen strengthening to 153.66/USD on BoJ rate hike expectations (April meeting).

- **Asian markets broadly higher** despite weak US retail sales released Tuesday. The "bad news is good news" dynamic had been in play -- weaker US data raises rate-cut expectations. Taiwan +1.7% on semiconductor strength is notable for the AI/chip thesis.

---

## 3. Europe Recap

European markets near record highs heading into Wednesday, following mixed earnings-driven sessions.

| Index | Level | Change (Tues close) | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------------------|-------|
| STOXX 600 | ~621 | +0.7% | At/near record high |
| DAX | ~25,015 | +1.2% | Defense spending & industrial strength |
| FTSE 100 | ~10,386 | +0.2% | Modest, defensive tilt |
| CAC 40 | ~8,323 | +0.6% | Dassault Systemes -19% weighed |

**Notable European movers:**
- **Dassault Systemes** plunged **19%** -- worst STOXX 600 performer after profit miss and modest 2026 growth guidance
- **Siemens Energy** surged **5%** after net profit nearly tripled
- **Heineken** +3% on higher FY25 profits

The STOXX 600 has reached record highs. European markets had been pricing in weaker US data supporting Fed rate cuts, but the strong US jobs print may cause a reassessment. The DAX continues to lead, driven by defense spending commitments and industrial strength.

## 4. Pre-Market Movers

### Today's Key Pre-Market Movers (Earnings-Driven)

**Winners:**

| Ticker | Move | Catalyst |
|--------|------|----------|
| **TDC** (Teradata) | **+18%** | Strong FY26 outlook -- adj. EPS $2.55-$2.65 vs. $2.54 consensus |
| **LSCC** (Lattice Semi) | **+11%** | Strong current-quarter guidance; edge AI/programmable logic demand |
| **NET** (Cloudflare) | **+7%** | Q4 beat + FY26 revenue guide $2.79-2.80B vs. $2.74B consensus |
| **GNRC** (Generac) | **+6%** | Despite Q4 miss, data center backlog growing; hyperscaler demand cited |
| **HUM** (Humana) | +2% | Q4 loss of $3.96 (adj.) beat est. of $4.01 loss; revenue $32.52B beat |

| **AKAM** (Akamai) | +5.4% | Earnings beat |

**Losers:**

| Ticker | Move | Catalyst |
|--------|------|----------|
| **MAT** (Mattel) | **-26%** | Missed FY25 sales and profit targets; disappointing FY26 guidance |
| **LYFT** | **-17%** | Q4 bookings in-line; weak Q1 adj. EBITDA guide ($120-140M vs. $139.8M) |
| **AVTR** (Avantor) | **-11%** | FY26 EPS guidance 77-83c far below 90c consensus |
| **MRNA** (Moderna) | **-10%** | FDA refused to review application for experimental flu shot mRNA-1010 |
| **SPGI** (S&P Global) | **-9%** | Weak Q4 adj. EPS + below-consensus FY26 guidance |
| **ZG** (Zillow) | **-7%** | Q4 EPS miss ($0.39 vs. $0.40); weak Q1 adj. EBITDA guide |

| **GILD** (Gilead) | -2% | FY26 product revenue guide $29.6-30.0B vs. $30.26B consensus |

### Thesis-Relevant Tickers in Pre-Market

- **NET (Cloudflare) +7%** -- **Cybersecurity Thesis Tier 2 name.** Strong Q4 beat and raised FY26 guide ($2.79-2.80B) validates the security/CDN/edge compute thesis. 28-31% growth sustained. Bullish for cloud security/SASE convergence theme.

- **GNRC (Generac) +6%** -- Relevant to the **AI/Data Center Power thesis.** CEO noted data center presence grew significantly and expects hyperscaler backlog additions. Validates the power infrastructure demand thesis alongside ETN, VRT, CEG.

- **LSCC (Lattice Semi) +11%** -- Strong guidance suggests healthy demand in edge AI/industrial programmable logic. Positive read-through for semiconductor demand broadly.

- **F (Ford) +1.5%** -- Relevant to **Energy Storage/EV thesis.** Strong FY26 EBIT guidance suggests the hybrid pivot is working. The company continues its strategic retreat from pure BEVs ($19.5B in prior special charges). Mixed signal for EV ecosystem.

## 5. Economic Calendar -- Wednesday, Feb 11, 2026

| Time (ET) | Release | Actual | Consensus | Prior |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **8:30 AM** | **January Nonfarm Payrolls** | **+130,000** | **+55,000** | +48,000 (rev. down) |
| **8:30 AM** | **Unemployment Rate** | **4.3%** | 4.4% | 4.4% |
| 8:30 AM | Average Hourly Earnings | TBD | +0.3% MoM | +0.3% |
| Released | China CPI (Jan) | +0.2% YoY | +0.4% | +0.8% |
| Released | China PPI (Jan) | -1.4% YoY | -1.5% | -1.9% |

### The January Jobs Report: A Massive Upside Surprise

**Nonfarm payrolls surged +130,000** -- more than double the 55,000 Dow Jones consensus and far above the most optimistic estimates. December was revised slightly downward to +48,000.

**Key details:**
- **Health care and social assistance** drove the bulk of job gains
- **Federal government** jobs fell by 34,000 as DOGE-related deferred resignations rolled off the payroll count
- **Unemployment rate** ticked down to 4.3% vs. 4.4% expected
- This was the first payrolls report of 2026, delayed by the government shutdown

**Market implications:**
- **Rate-cut expectations slashed:** Money markets now price the next Fed cut in **July** (previously June). The "three cuts in 2026" scenario has become significantly less likely.
- **Equities reversed:** The S&P 500's initial surge to near all-time highs faded as yields surged and software stocks sold off hard (-3.5% sector ETF).
- **"Good news is bad news":** A strong labor market reduces the urgency for Fed easing, which is negative for duration-sensitive growth stocks.

---

## 6. Fed Speakers

| Speaker | Event | Key Focus |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Chair Jerome Powell** | **House Financial Services Committee testimony** (Humphrey-Hawkins Day 2) | Semiannual monetary policy report; will likely be asked about strong jobs data |
| **Dallas Fed Pres. Logan** | Spoke Feb 10 | **Hawkish:** "No further rate cuts needed" if inflation stays on path |
| Vice Chair Michelle Bowman | Scheduled today | Monetary policy |
| Gov. Christopher Waller | GIC Dollar Summit | Economic outlook / dollar |
| Vice Chair Philip Jefferson | Scheduled today | TBD |
| Gov. Lisa Cook | Scheduled today | TBD |

**Key context:** Powell's Senate testimony yesterday struck a **"no urgency to cut"** tone:
- Inflation has moved closer to 2% target but remains "somewhat elevated" (PCE 2.6% YoY, core PCE 2.8%)
- Fed has already cut 100 bps since September 2024, bringing funds rate to 4.25-4.50%
- Powell described current rate as "appropriate"
- Acknowledged uncertainty from tariffs, fiscal policy, and regulation
- Signaled data-dependence, not a preset path

**Today's strong jobs data reinforces the hold posture.** Expect Powell to be asked about the jobs surprise in his House testimony. Multiple governors speaking today will likely echo the "patient" message. The gap between market pricing and Fed rhetoric has narrowed after the jobs beat.

---

## 7. Key Rates & Yields

Treasury yields surged across the curve on the stronger-than-expected jobs report:

| Maturity | Yield | Change |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 2-Year | **3.518%** | **+6 bps** |
| 10-Year | **4.182%** | **+3 bps** |
| 30-Year | **4.81%** | **+2 bps** |

**Direction:** Sharply higher post-jobs data. The 2-year moved most aggressively (+6 bps), reflecting reduced near-term rate-cut expectations. The 10Y had been trending lower toward 4.15% (its lowest since mid-January) before snapping back.

**Yield curve:** The 2s/10s spread sits around **+66 bps**, maintaining its positive slope. The short end's outsized move slightly flattened the curve -- reflecting fewer expected near-term cuts.

**Pre-jobs context:** Yields had been declining for two consecutive sessions on weak retail sales data and rising rate-cut bets. The strong payroll print has reversed that trend.

**Implication for thesis sectors:** Higher-for-longer rates pressure duration-sensitive names (pre-revenue quantum plays like OKLO, SMR, IONQ; growth names like RKLB) but support the case that the economy is strong enough to sustain hyperscaler capex plans (positive for AI infrastructure thesis).

---

## 8. DXY (Dollar Index)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DXY Level | **~96.68** |
| Change | -0.12% (but firming post-jobs) |

**Direction:** The dollar had been weakening into the jobs report, hitting its lowest level of the month at ~96.68. The strong payroll print has caused it to firm modestly, though it remains near session lows.

**Drivers:**
- Strong jobs data supports the dollar by reducing rate-cut expectations
- Broader 2025-2026 downtrend reflects narrowing rate differentials as the Fed has already cut 100 bps
- Reports of Chinese regulators advising financial institutions to limit US Treasury holdings are an ongoing headwind

**Impact:** Dollar weakness broadly supports commodities (gold at $5,061, oil at $64-65 WTI). The post-jobs firming is modest and has not reversed the broader trend.

---

## 9. Oil

| Contract | Level | Change |
|----------|-------|--------|
| WTI Crude | **~$64.41/bbl** | Flat to slightly up |
| Brent Crude | **~$69.30/bbl** | +0.3% (3rd consecutive gain) |

**Direction:** Modest gains, range-bound near $64-65 WTI.

**Drivers:**
- **Bullish:** US-Iran tensions persist despite signs of progress in nuclear talks; stronger jobs data supports demand outlook
- **Bearish:** API reported massive +13.4M barrel US crude inventory build last week (largest since Nov 2023)
- **Neutral:** OPEC+ production discipline continues but demand growth is tepid

Oil remains stuck in a $60-70 WTI range. The massive inventory build is a headwind. For the energy thesis, low oil prices do not affect the data center power/nuclear/renewables thesis but reduce urgency around traditional energy plays.

---

## 10. Gold

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Spot Gold | **~$5,061/oz** |
| Change | **+0.74%** |

**Direction:** Higher, continuing its remarkable 2026 rally. Gold is up ~10% month-over-month and **+74% year-over-year**.

**Drivers:**
- Central bank buying remains strong globally
- Geopolitical uncertainty (US-Iran, Ukraine, tariff policy)
- Strong physical demand -- CME raised margin requirements from 6% to 8% after January record highs
- Even the strong jobs report has not dented gold -- it serves as a hedge against both inflation and geopolitical risk simultaneously

Gold above $5,000/oz is extraordinary. For the **critical minerals thesis**, gold strength benefits miners with gold exposure (PPTA -- Perpetua Resources, antimony + gold). For the **nuclear/uranium thesis**, general commodity strength is supportive.

---

## 11. Crypto

| Asset | Level | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Bitcoin (BTC) | **~$66,000** | **-3.0%** |
| Ethereum (ETH) | **~$1,950** | **-3.5%** |
| XRP | ~$1.37 | -2.0% |
| Dogecoin | ~$0.09 | -3.0% |

**Direction:** Sharply lower, extending a multi-week selloff. BTC has dropped below the critical 200-week EMA at $68,000. Third consecutive session of decline.

**Drivers:**
- Strong jobs report reduces rate-cut expectations, tightening financial conditions -- negative for risk assets
- Bitcoin down significantly from October 2024 peak above $126,000 (now -47%)
- Bitcoin ETF outflows: nearly $500M in a recent week
- Broader risk-off sentiment in speculative assets

**Quantum thesis note:** The ~$718B in Bitcoin held in quantum-vulnerable addresses (P2PK) identified in the quantum thesis remains a long-term structural risk. The current selloff is macro-driven, not quantum-related.

- **CSCO (Cisco) -- AMC**: Networking results provide read-through on data center switching demand -- directly relevant to ANET (Tier 1 AI watchlist).

- **GFS (GlobalFoundries) -- BMO**: Mature-node foundry demand color matters for the semiconductor ecosystem.

---

## Sector Watchlist Impact Summary

### Macro Impact from Today's Events:

| Sector | Impact | Key Driver |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **AI Infrastructure** | Mixed | Cloudflare +7% and Generac data center commentary are bullish; but higher-for-longer rates pressure high multiples. VRT earnings are the key event. |
| **Nuclear** | Mixed | Strong economy supports hyperscaler capex (positive for CEG, VST PPA thesis); higher yields pressure utility valuations |
| **Defense** | Insulated | Backlogs and budget cycle are the drivers, not macro. LMT, RTX, NOC unaffected by jobs data |
| **Cybersecurity** | Positive | NET +7% validates cloud security spending. Software selloff (-3.5%) may create entry points in PANW, CRWD, ZS |
| **Critical Minerals** | Positive | Gold $5,061 benefits PPTA and gold-exposed miners. Copper/lithium neutral. China CPI miss is mixed -- weak demand but stimulus expectations |
| **Quantum** | Negative | Rate-sensitive pre-revenue names (IONQ, QBTS, RGTI) vulnerable to yields backing up |
| **Robotics** | Modestly positive | LSCC +11% is positive for automation cycle recovery. Rockwell's recent Q1 beat already signaled recovery |
| **Energy Storage** | Mixed | Ford FY26 guidance suggests hybrid pivot working; EV ecosystem mixed signals persist. Lithium prices stable |
| **Space** | Neutral | No specific movers today. Artemis II (March 6) and SpaceX IPO (mid-2026) remain near-term catalysts |

### Key Watchlist Tickers to Monitor Today:

## Key Themes for Today

1. **January jobs surprise reshapes rate expectations.** NFP of +130K (vs. +55K expected) was the session's dominant event. Rate-cut expectations have been pushed from June to July. The "good news is bad news" dynamic is back -- strong economy means fewer rate cuts, which pressures high-multiple growth stocks.

2. **Intraday equity reversal is the tell.** The S&P 500's initial surge to near all-time highs followed by a fade, with software stocks -3.5%, signals that the market is rate-sensitive at these valuations. Watch whether the reversal deepens or stabilizes.

3. **Powell's House testimony (Humphrey-Hawkins Day 2).** The strong jobs print reinforces Powell's "no urgency to cut" stance. His real-time commentary on the data will be closely parsed. Expect him to emphasize data-dependence and patience.

4. **VRT earnings -- AI infrastructure pulse check.** Vertiv reporting pre-market is the most important single-stock event for the AI thesis today. The power/cooling supply chain has the highest revenue visibility in AI infrastructure.

5. **Gold above $5,000 while crypto crashes.** A striking divergence: gold at all-time highs ($5,061) while BTC is down 47% from October highs. Reflects rotation from speculative to traditional safe-haven assets.

6. **China deflation persists.** CPI miss (+0.2% vs +0.4%) keeps pressure on Beijing for stimulus. Mixed for critical minerals thesis -- weak demand near-term but stimulus expectations provide a floor.

7. **Dow at records, Nasdaq lagging.** The Dow above 50,000 while Nasdaq fell -0.6% Tuesday reflects tech-to-value rotation. Benefits defense primes (LMT, RTX, NOC) and power/industrial names (ETN, VRT) while pressuring high-multiple tech growth.
