## Pre-Market Snapshot

| Instrument | Level | Change | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| S&P 500 Futures | 6,853 | -0.97% | Schwab |
| Nasdaq 100 Futures | 24,808 | -1.09% | Schwab |
| Dow Futures | 48,944 | -1.19% | Schwab |

| 2Y Yield | 3.450% | — | FRED (prev close) |
| 30Y Yield | 4.650% | -0.41% | Schwab |
| 2s/10s Spread | +0.539% | — | Calculated |
| DXY | 97.81 | +0.09% | Stooq |
| WTI Crude | $67.45 | +3.44% | Schwab |
| Brent Crude | $73.21 | +3.35% | Schwab |

| Bitcoin | $66,089 | -2.96% | CoinGecko |
| Ethereum | $1,956 | -5.42% | CoinGecko |

**Color:** Ugly tape. Futures pointing to a broad selloff with Russell 2000 leading down (-1.65%), signaling risk-off breadth is hitting small caps hardest. The VIX has jumped 16% to 21.61, crossing into the elevated regime — a sharp move from yesterday's 17.75. The bond market is screaming safety bid: the 10Y yield collapsed to 3.989% (anomalous z-score of -3.2) and the 30Y fell to 4.650% (z-score -3.7), both flagged as statistical anomalies. This is the market pricing in economic slowdown fears despite hotter inflation data — a potential stagflation setup.

The crude oil spike (+3.44% WTI to $67.45) is counter-trend, likely supply-driven rather than demand — a geopolitical premium after Russia-Ukraine Zaporizhzhia truce talks and Iran nuclear negotiation uncertainty. Gold is the quiet winner, ticking higher to $5,228. Crypto is getting hammered: Bitcoin -2.96% and Ethereum -5.42%, reversing yesterday's bounce as risk appetite evaporates. DXY is flat at 97.81 — the dollar isn't participating in the safety trade, with bonds absorbing the flows.

The 2s/10s spread compressed to +54 bps from +62 bps yesterday, with the long end rallying harder. This is a classic flight-to-quality pattern.

## Overnight & Global Markets

| Market | Level | Change | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Nikkei 225 | 58,850 | +0.16% | Schwab |
| Hang Seng | 26,631 | +0.95% | Schwab |
| Kospi | 6,244 | +0.75% | Stooq |
| DAX | 25,266 | -0.09% | Schwab |
| CAC 40 | 8,585 | -0.42% | Schwab |
| FTSE 100 | 10,881 | +0.27% | Stooq |
| Europe STOXX 50 (FEZ) | 69.03 | -0.19% | Schwab |
| Australia (EWA) | 30.15 | +0.03% | Schwab |

**Asia session:** Broadly positive overnight. Hang Seng rebounded +0.95% after yesterday's -1.44% decline, with tech names recovering. Kospi held gains at +0.75% following yesterday's 3% surge. Nikkei was a non-event (+0.16%). Asia closed before the US pre-market selloff accelerated — tonight's Asian session will be the true test.

**Europe session:** Continental Europe is where the weakness started this morning. CAC 40 -0.42% and DAX -0.09% turned negative as PPI data hit. FTSE 100 bucked the trend at +0.27%, benefiting from energy and mining heavyweights catching the crude oil bid. The STOXX 50 at -0.19% reflects the cautious continental tone.

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Event | Impact | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 8:30 AM | Core PPI m/m | HIGH | **Released: +0.8%** (Consensus: 0.3%, Prior: 0.7%) |
| 8:30 AM | PPI m/m | HIGH | **Released: Hot** (Consensus: 0.3%, Prior: 0.5%) |
| 9:45 AM | Chicago PMI | Low | Scheduled — Consensus: 52.0, Prior: 54.0 |
| 10:00 AM | Construction Spending m/m | Low | Scheduled — Prior: 0.5% |

**PPI Reaction:** The headline number is the Core PPI at +0.8% m/m — nearly triple the 0.3% consensus and above even the prior month's hot 0.7% reading. This is the third consecutive upside inflation surprise and points to persistent wholesale price pressure. The market reaction has been swift: equities selling, bonds rallying (counterintuitively — growth scare outweighing inflation), and VIX spiking. The Fed's March 18 meeting just got more interesting — CME pricing had 60% hold / 38% cut; cut odds should compress further on this print.

*Note: Economic calendar module showed Actual = "—" due to collection timing; release confirmed via Market Intelligence and RSS feeds in the same briefing file.*

## Thesis Watchlist Update

### Earnings Reporting Today

| Symbol | Sector | Time | Status |
|--------|--------|------|--------|
| SQM | Energy Storage | Before Open | Pending — no results at collection time |

SQM is a Tier 1 energy storage/lithium name. Watch for lithium pricing commentary and 2026 guidance given lithium's recent recovery above $20,000/tonne. The Codelco JV economics will be closely scrutinized.

### Notable Tier 1 Moves (|change| > 3%)

| Symbol | Sector | Price | Change | RSI | Signal |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-----|--------|
| ZS | Cybersecurity | $147 | **-12.27%** | 41 | Trading 45% below SMA200 ($266). Extreme dislocation. |
| RKLB | Space | $68.05 | **-6.33%** | 48 | Neutron delay catalyst. Still 29% above SMA200 ($52.66). |
| LUNR | Space | $16.76 | **-5.15%** | 50 | 35% above SMA200 ($12.38). Risk-off sympathy. |
| IONQ | Quantum | $38.85 | **-4.97%** | 56 | 18% below SMA200 ($47.52). Approaching key levels. |
| FLNC | Energy Storage | $15.45 | **-4.63%** | 33 | **Approaching oversold.** 11% above SMA200 ($13.92). |
| VRT | AI Infrastructure | $249 | **-3.98%** | 75 | **Still overbought at RSI 75** despite the drop. 61% above SMA200 ($155). |
| MP | Critical Minerals | $57.90 | **-3.50%** | 50 | Right at SMA200 ($56.66) — testing key support. |
| LEU | Nuclear | $205 | **-3.04%** | 41 | 15% below SMA200 ($242). Weakening trend. |

### RSI Extremes

- **Overbought (RSI > 70):** VRT (75), CGNX (68), SYK (67)
- **Approaching Oversold (RSI < 40):** FLNC (33), IBM (35), PANW (35), CRWD (40), LEU (41)

PANW and CRWD both approaching oversold territory ahead of CRWD earnings on March 3 — potential setup if the report is solid.

### Approaching Catalysts

| Date | Event | Tickers | Source |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Mar 3** | CrowdStrike (CRWD) earnings | CRWD | Earnings Calendar |
| **Mar 4** | Broadcom (AVGO) earnings | AVGO | Earnings Calendar |
| **Mar 6** | Artemis II launch | LUNR, RKLB | Space Thesis |
| **Mar 9** | Triple Witch positioning starts | Broad market | Market Calendar |
| **Mar 17-20** | **FOMC + Triple Witch + S&P Rebalance convergence** | Broad market | Market Calendar |
| **Mar 27** | NRC Part 53 final rule | Nuclear sector | Nuclear Thesis |
| **Q1 2026** | TerraPower construction permit | Nuclear sector | Nuclear Thesis |
| **Q1 2026** | AMD MI400 launch | AMD, NVDA | AI Thesis |
| **Q2 2026** | Cerebras IPO | AI sector | AI Thesis |

The March 17-20 convergence of FOMC (with updated dot plot), Triple Witch ($5-6.5T notional), and S&P rebalance is the most structurally important window in the near term. Historical pattern: long Monday of witching week → exit Thursday close; avoid witching Friday.

### Key Technical Levels Under Pressure

| Symbol | Price | SMA200 | Distance | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| AVGO | $313 | $318 | **-1.6%** | ⚠️ Below SMA200 — z-score anomaly (-4.0) |
| ANET | $127 | $127 | **0%** | ⚠️ Sitting directly on SMA200 support |
| MP | $57.90 | $56.66 | +2.2% | Testing SMA200 |
| NVDA | $182 | $175 | +4.0% | Approaching SMA200 |
| TSLA | $403 | $390 | +3.3% | Approaching SMA200 |

AVGO breaking below its 200-day moving average is a significant technical event. Earnings on March 4 become a make-or-break moment.

## Market Context & Playbook

### VIX Regime Assessment

VIX at 21.61 (+16% intraday) — **elevated regime**. This is the highest VIX reading in weeks, having jumped from 17.75 yesterday. The magnitude of the single-day VIX move (+16%) suggests institutional hedging demand, not just retail panic. When VIX crosses above 20, historical data shows increased intraday volatility and wider bid-ask spreads. Expect choppy, headline-driven price action today.

### Today's Bias: BEARISH

**Rationale from the data:**
1. **Hot PPI (+0.8% Core vs 0.3% expected)** — removes a rate cut catalyst and keeps the Fed hawkish into March 18
2. **AI sector rotation accelerating** — CRWV guidance miss confirms fears; S&P 500 software underperformance is worst since the dotcom bust per Market Intelligence
3. **VIX regime shift** — 21.61 with +16% daily move signals sustained volatility, not a one-day event
4. **Bond market anomaly** — yields crashing despite hot inflation = the market is pricing recession risk over inflation risk. This is the stagflation signal
5. **Breadth collapse** — Russell 2000 leading lower (-1.65%) with 25+ watchlist names down >3%
6. **Friday positioning** — traders unlikely to add risk into the weekend with this volatility profile

### Key Levels to Watch

- **S&P 500:** Futures at 6,853 (prev close 6,909). The 6,850 level is psychological support; a break below targets the 50-day moving average
- **Nasdaq:** 24,808 futures approaching month-end, on track for steepest monthly decline in years
- **VIX 25:** If VIX pushes above 25, expect systematic selling from vol-targeting funds
- **10Y Yield 4.00%:** The 3.989% reading is just below the round number. A close below 4% would be a significant signal

### Risk Factors

1. **Stagflation narrative gaining traction** — hot inflation + slowing growth indicators is the worst macro combo for equities
2. **Month-end rebalancing** — pension funds and systematic strategies rebalance today (last trading day of February). This can amplify moves in either direction
3. **AI capex narrative under pressure** — CoreWeave guidance miss + NVIDIA's constrained GPU supply warning + 42% enterprise AI project abandonment rate (from AI thesis) are building a bear case
4. **Weekend risk premium** — Ukraine-Russia nuclear plant truce, Iran nuclear talks, and general geopolitical uncertainty mean traders will demand a risk premium for holding positions over the weekend

### Potential Contrarian Signal

The extreme breadth of the selloff creates potential mean-reversion opportunities for:
- **Defense primes** (LMT +0.83%, NOC +0.58%, RTX +0.46%) — the only green sector; structural demand is non-discretionary
- **FLNC** (RSI 33) — approaching oversold with a $5.5B backlog
- **CRWD/PANW** — both approaching oversold ahead of CRWD's March 3 earnings
