# BigPic Morning Brief

## Event Load: HEAVY — Tuesday, February 24

Consumer confidence, housing data, Richmond Fed manufacturing, and a parade of six FOMC speakers make this a packed session. Pair that with NVDA earnings tomorrow before the open, a massive AMD-Meta deal reshaping the AI chip narrative, IBM's worst day in 26 years, and crypto in freefall — there's a lot to process. Jamie Dimon's "high anxiety" warning about lofty asset prices sets the mood.

## Pre-Market Snapshot

| S&P 500 Futures | 6,853 | +0.02% | Schwab |
| Nasdaq 100 Futures | 24,829 | +0.27% | Schwab |
| Dow Futures | 48,920 | +0.15% | Schwab |
| Russell 2000 Futures | 2,628 | +0.08% | Schwab |
| VIX | 21.36 | +1.67% | Schwab |
| 10Y Yield | 4.029% | flat | Schwab |
| 2Y Yield | 3.480% | — | FRED (prev close) |
| 30Y Yield | 4.696% | flat | Schwab |
| 2s/10s Spread | +0.549% | — | Calculated |
| DXY | 97.81 | +0.13% | Stooq |

| Bitcoin | $62,992 | -4.92% | CoinGecko |
| Ethereum | $1,824 | -5.18% | CoinGecko |

**Color:** Equity futures are barely positive overnight — the S&P essentially flat while Nasdaq edges higher on AMD's massive rally. The bond market is quiet with the 10Y pinned at 4.03%, consistent with the Treasury yields falling at their fastest rate in 5 months. VIX ticking up to 21.36 in elevated territory signals hedging demand remains firm. Dollar is soft near 97.81, reflecting the broader rate-cut repricing. Gold pulling back nearly 1% from recent highs. The real story is crypto: Bitcoin plunging nearly 5% to $63K and Ethereum down 5.2% — the "AI risk-off" trade bleeding into digital assets, with 400K+ BTC accumulated between $60-70K during this downturn per CoinDesk.

## Overnight & Global Markets

| Market | Level | Change | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Nikkei 225 | 57,321 | +0.87% | Schwab |
| Hang Seng | 26,590 | -1.82% | Schwab |
| DAX | 24,928 | -0.26% | Schwab |
| CAC 40 | 8,493 | -0.05% | Schwab |
| FTSE 100 | 10,675 | -0.08% | Stooq |
| Kospi | 5,970 | +1.94% | Stooq |
| Europe STOXX 50 (FEZ) | 68.18 | -0.50% | Schwab |
| Europe Broad (IEV) | 73.89 | +0.50% | Schwab |

**Asia session:** Mixed. Nikkei up 0.87% and Kospi surging nearly 2% — the South Korean rally likely reflecting semiconductor strength (Samsung/SK Hynix riding the AMD-Meta deal wave). Hang Seng was the weak spot, falling 1.82% on continued China growth concerns and the broader tech selloff.

**Europe session:** Slightly soft across the board. DAX -0.26%, CAC -0.05%, FTSE -0.08%. European markets digesting the Supreme Court tariff ruling that throws trade policy into flux, with EU threatening retaliation. The STOXX 50 down 0.50% but the broader IEV basket up 0.50%, suggesting divergence between mega-cap and mid-cap performance.

## Thesis Watchlist Update

### Earnings Reporting Today

| Symbol | Sector | Time | EPS Est | Status |
|--------|--------|------|---------|--------|
| **CEG** | Nuclear Energy (Tier 1) | Before Open | — | **Pending** — Report expected this morning. Company's outlook will be the key focus (per Barron's headline). Watch for hyperscaler PPA commentary and Calpine acquisition updates. |

### Upcoming Watchlist Earnings — This Week

| Symbol | Sector | Date | Time |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| **NVDA** | AI Infrastructure (Tier 1) | **Wed Feb 25** | Before Open |
| **ZS** | Cybersecurity (Tier 1) | **Thu Feb 26** | Before Open |
| **RKLB** | Space (Tier 2) | **Thu Feb 26** | Before Open |
| **VST** | Nuclear Energy (Tier 1) | **Thu Feb 26** | Before Open |
| **MP** | Critical Minerals (Tier 1) | **Thu Feb 26** | Before Open |

NVDA tomorrow is the event of the week. The AMD-Meta deal sets up an interesting read-through — validates non-NVIDIA AI silicon demand, which could be read as both competitive threat and total market expansion.

### Notable Tier 1 Moves & RSI Extremes

| Symbol | Sector | Price | Change | RSI | Signal |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-----|--------|
| **CRWD** | Cybersecurity | $350 | -0.24% | **28** | Deeply oversold. Trading 17% below SMA20, 23% below SMA50. Software selloff driven by AI disruption fears. |
| **PANW** | Cybersecurity | $144 | flat | **25** | Deeply oversold. 13% below SMA20, 19% below SMA50. Same AI disruption theme hitting all cyber names. |
| **ZS** | Cybersecurity | $145 | +1.09% | **19** | Extreme oversold — lowest RSI on the watchlist. 46% below SMA200. Earnings Thu could catalyze a bounce or break. |
| **LEU** | Nuclear Energy | $199 | -1.05% | **38** | Below all major SMAs. Pulled back sharply from highs. |
| **FLNC** | Energy Storage | $16.01 | -0.37% | **32** | 30% below SMA20 and SMA50. Compressed. |
| **IBM** | Quantum Computing | $224 | +0.29% | **23** | Extreme oversold after 13% crash. 20% below SMA200. Unprecedented AI disruption headline. |
| **VRT** | AI Infrastructure | $245 | flat | **72** | Overbought territory. 60% above SMA200 — strongest relative strength on Tier 1 list. |
| **CGNX** | Robotics | $56.47 | flat | **76** | Overbought. 44% above SMA200. Industrial automation recovery play. |
| **LMT** | Defense | $661 | flat | **70** | Near overbought. 35% above SMA200. Benefiting from defense supercycle thesis. |

**Cybersecurity is the sector under most pressure.** CRWD, PANW, ZS, and FTNT all have RSIs in the 19-38 range — this is the broad "AI disruption threatens software" narrative creating a potential capitulation setup. ZS at RSI 19 before Thursday earnings is the most extreme.

## Market Context & Playbook

**VIX Regime:** Elevated at 21.36 (+1.67%). SPY trend is bearish, risk appetite is cautious. We are in a "fragile and anxious" market as the briefing characterizes it.

**Today's Bias: Neutral-to-cautious.** The push-pull is clear:

*Bullish forces:*
- AMD-Meta $100B deal validates AI infrastructure spending beyond NVIDIA
- Home Depot earnings beat suggests consumer resilience
- Mortgage rates below 6% (lowest since 2022) support housing
- Defense spending signals remain strong ($152B FY26 Pentagon plan)
- Treasury yields falling fast — rate-cut repricing underway
- Multiple cybersecurity names at extreme oversold RSIs (potential bounce)

*Bearish forces:*
- IBM's worst day in 26 years on AI disruption to legacy software — contagion risk to software broadly
- Software called "screaming cheap" but the selling continues (AI Armageddon fears)
- Crypto breaking down hard (BTC -5%, ETH -5.2%) — risk-off signal
- Supreme Court tariff ruling creates trade policy uncertainty
- VIX elevated and rising
- 9 of 10 most-watched valuation indicators in "sell" territory per MarketWatch
- Jamie Dimon warns of "high anxiety" and lofty asset prices

**Key levels to watch:**
- S&P 500: 6,838 (Friday close), 6,853 (futures). SMA200 at ~652 on SPY (well below — not yet in play)
- Nasdaq: 22,627 (close). Futures slightly higher on AMD lift
- VIX: 21.36 — a break above 22-23 would signal hedging acceleration
- Bitcoin: $62,992 — the $60K level is the institutional accumulation floor. A break below would be significant
- DXY: 97.81 — dollar weakness supports risk assets but also reflects growth concerns

**Risk factors today:**
1. Six FOMC speakers could create headline volatility on rate-path commentary
2. Consumer confidence (15:00) is the data event — miss could deepen risk-off sentiment
3. NVDA pre-positioning ahead of tomorrow's earnings — expect elevated options activity
4. Software selloff could accelerate if IBM contagion spreads
5. Tariff uncertainty from Supreme Court ruling — EU retaliation threats, FedEx suing for refunds

|--------|--------|----------|
| **AI Infrastructure** | Mixed-to-bullish | AMD +9.6% on $100B Meta deal; TSM +2.4%; ASML EUV breakthrough. But IBM -13% on AI disruption fears creates two-sided narrative. NVDA earnings tomorrow. |

| **Quantum Computing** | Mixed | IONQ wins Missile Defense SHIELD contract (bullish); IBM crash drags the quantum-via-IBM play. IQM SPAC listing; Cloudflare PQC rollout. |
| **Robotics & Automation** | Neutral | CGNX overbought at RSI 76. SYM flat. No major catalysts today. Industrial cycle recovery thesis intact. |
| **Space** | Constructive | ASTS wins $30M military demo + SDA satellite contract. LUNR flat. Space Force expansion push. LambdaVision books Starlab space. |
| **Crypto** | Bearish | BTC -4.9% to $63K, ETH -5.2%. Broad altcoin losses. WLFI stablecoin under attack. Institutional accumulation $60-70K is the floor to watch. |
