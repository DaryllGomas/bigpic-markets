## Unusual Options Activity

**Watchlist-Relevant Activity (Feb 10, 2026):**

| Ticker | Activity | Detail |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **FROG (JFrog)** | 6x daily average volume | Call buying focused on March 20th $60.00 strike. JFrog is Tier 2 Cybersecurity (supply chain security). Potential earnings or M&A speculation. |
| **LEU (Centrus Energy)** | Elevated pre-earnings | Implied move +/-14.9% priced in for today's after-close report. Options market expects ~$39 move. |
| **VRT (Vertiv)** | Elevated pre-earnings | Reporting tomorrow Feb 11; expect options activity to build intraday. |

**Non-Watchlist but Notable:**
- **IR (Ingersoll Rand):** ~100:1 call-to-put ratio; bullish Feb 20th $100 calls bought at ask. Industrial/automation adjacent.
- **RVMD (Revolution Medicines):** ~30:1 put-to-call ratio; large bearish blocks on June 18th $80/$50 puts. Healthcare/biotech.
- **RUM (Rumble):** 11x daily average; speculative call buying. Not on watchlist.

**Options Activity Watch for This Week:**

- **VRT** (Feb 11 earnings): Data center power theme beta
- Broader market positioning ahead of potential economic data releases

---

## Key Themes for Today

1. **LEU Earnings After Close** -- The only Tier 1 watchlist name reporting today. HALEU production scale and DOE expansion updates will set tone for nuclear fuel cycle names.

2. **Google-Wiz EU Decision** -- The European Commission's Phase 1 deadline on Google's $32B Wiz acquisition is today. Approval validates CNAPP at extreme multiples and benefits remaining cloud security players (PANW, CRWD, ZS). Escalation to Phase II would delay closing.

3. **NexGen CNSC Hearing (Day 2 of 4)** -- Final regulatory hurdle for the largest new uranium mine. Indigenous community support has been strong. Positive outcome bullish for CCJ, URA, and uranium sector broadly.

4. **VRT Earnings Tomorrow** -- Vertiv at new all-time highs ahead of earnings. AI data center power demand narrative gets tested. Book-to-bill ratio and backlog growth are key metrics.

5. **RTX Framework Agreements (Feb 4)** -- Five landmark missile production deals just signed. Tomahawk >1,000/yr, AMRAAM >1,900/yr. Validates the defense munitions supercycle thesis across RTX and LMT.

6. **QuantumScape Eagle Line Inaugurated (Feb 4)** -- Solid-state battery pilot production launched with OEM partners. Technology validation event for energy storage thesis.

7. **Palisades Restart** -- NRC meetings with Holtec this week on steam generator repairs. If restart succeeds in Feb/Mar, it will be the first US nuclear plant reactivated from decommissioning.
