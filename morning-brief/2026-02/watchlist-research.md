## 1. Pre-Market Activity on Thesis Watchlist Tickers

### Major Macro Context

The delayed January Non-Farm Payrolls report released this morning at 8:30 AM ET came in well above expectations: **+130,000 jobs vs. 55,000 consensus** (and vs. December's revised +48,000). Unemployment ticked down to 4.3% (vs. 4.4% expected). This is the strongest month for job creation since December 2024, after a year in which job creation averaged just 15,000/month. Markets reacted positively -- S&P 500 +0.6%, Nasdaq +0.8%, Dow +0.4% (Dow touched all-time high). BLS also released final benchmark revisions showing March 2025 payrolls revised down by 898,000 -- a significant historical revision.

Health care (+82K) and social assistance (+42K) drove nearly all the net job creation. Construction added 33K after a flat year.

### Watchlist Movers

**VRT (Vertiv) -- Tier 1 AI Infrastructure -- UP ~15-23%**
The standout watchlist mover today. Vertiv reported Q4/FY2025 earnings before the open with a massive beat:
- Organic orders surged **252% YoY**
- Backlog now at **$15 billion** (up from $9.5B cited in thesis -- a $5.5B increase in a single quarter)
- Revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and EPS all at or above high end of guidance
- Multiple analysts raised price targets to the **$260-$280 range**
- Stock trading near **$229**, up from ~$199 prior close
- **Thesis validation:** This confirms the AI data center power/cooling infrastructure thesis. The backlog explosion from $9.5B to $15B signals hyperscaler capex acceleration is real and intensifying. VRT's 252% organic order growth dramatically outpaces the "DC orders +200% YoY" cited in the thesis -- the demand is accelerating, not decelerating.

**GFS (GlobalFoundries) -- Adjacent Semiconductor -- BEAT**
- EPS $0.55 vs $0.44 est (+25% beat), Revenue $1.83B
- FY2025 revenue $6.79B, net income $888M
- Announced $500M buyback + acquisitions in AI, silicon photonics, and GaN
- Relevant to the semiconductor thesis -- validates demand resilience outside NVDA/TSM

**TSM (TSMC) -- Tier 1 AI Semiconductors -- UP ~1.8% pre-market (~$362)**
Modest pre-market strength. Continues to benefit from AI chip demand narrative and structural foundry monopoly position. CoWoS capacity expansion remains the key supply-side metric.

**NVDA (NVIDIA) -- Tier 1 AI Semiconductors -- ~$190-191**
Trading relatively flat around $190.91. No specific catalyst today. Rubin architecture updates remain the next major catalyst. Earnings Feb 26.

**AVGO (Broadcom) -- Tier 1 AI Semiconductors -- DOWN ~1.0% (~$340)**
Slight softness, no specific news. Custom silicon narrative intact.

**PANW (Palo Alto Networks) -- Tier 1 Cybersecurity -- DOWN ~1.5% (~$387)**
Weakness amid a broader software selloff -- an ETF tracking software giants tumbled 3.5% in early trading. No stock-specific news. Earnings Feb 17 with CyberArk integration update expected.

**CRWD (CrowdStrike) -- Tier 1 Cybersecurity -- ~$405-416**
Slight softness in sympathy with software sector weakness. No specific catalyst. FY2027 guidance at next report is the key event.

**FTNT (Fortinet) -- Tier 1 Cybersecurity -- ~$84**
Range-bound between $82-$86. FortiGate refresh cycle continues to drive.

**TSLA (Tesla) -- Tier 2 Robotics/AV/Energy Storage -- DOWN ~0.9% (~$339)**
Slight red amid mixed sentiment. Cybercab production start (April 2026) and Optimus production ramp remain key near-term catalysts. Megapack 3 shipments targeted H2 2026.

**IONQ (IonQ) -- Tier 1 Quantum -- ~$35-38 range**
Pulled back significantly from Jan 16 all-time high of $96.30, now down ~62% from peak. Q4 2025 earnings on Feb 25 is the next catalyst. Quantum sentiment has cooled broadly.

**RKLB (Rocket Lab) -- Tier 2 Space/Defense -- ~$72**
Down ~5% recently and ~25% from the Jan 16 ATH of $96.30. No specific catalyst; earnings Feb 26. Neutron development progress and SDA contract execution are key medium-term events.

**LMT (Lockheed Martin) -- Tier 1 Defense -- ~$630**
Trading near recent levels at $629.56. Defense sector continues to benefit from NATO rearmament and munitions supercycle. RTX framework agreements announced in recent weeks validate sustained demand.

**RTX (RTX Corporation) -- Tier 1 Defense -- ~$195**
Steady. Five landmark missile framework agreements (Tomahawk, AMRAAM, SM-6, SM-3) announced Feb 4 represent 2-4x production increases and provide multi-year revenue visibility.

### Nuclear Sector
- **CEG (Constellation Energy):** ~$308. Strong 2026 start on Meta nuclear deals and TMI restart progress. Palisades restart discussions ongoing.
- **VST (Vistra):** ~$167. Meta 2,609 MW deal providing 20-year visibility.  73-93% earnings growth guided for 2026.
- **OKLO:** ~$95. Pre-revenue but elevated on 1.2 GW Meta deal sentiment.

### Tickers Not Moving Notably
Most Tier 1 names across defense (NOC, LHX), cybersecurity (ZS, LDOS, CACI), critical minerals (MP, FCX), and other sectors are trading in-line with broad market moves on the jobs data, without stock-specific catalysts today.

| SHOP | Shopify | Not on watchlist | **BEAT** -- Rev $3.67B (+31% YoY); $2B buyback. Stock +12% | Shows AI-driven commerce strength |
| MCD | McDonald's | Not on watchlist | Est. EPS $3.05, Rev $6.83B | Consumer spending proxy |
| TMUS | T-Mobile | Not on watchlist | Reported; stock -4.3% | Telecom spending indicator |
| NTES | NetEase | Not on watchlist | Reported pre-market | China tech proxy |

### After-Close Reports (Today)

| Ticker | Company | Watchlist? | Estimate | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **ALB** | Albemarle | **Tier 1 Critical Minerals / Energy Storage** | EPS est. -$0.49 to -$0.62, Rev ~$1.35B | **Key lithium bellwether.** Watch Kings Mountain restart timeline + 2026 lithium price guidance |
| **CSCO** | Cisco Systems | Adjacent (networking) | EPS est. $0.94-$1.02, Rev $15.0-15.2B guide | Networking spend indicator; ANET competitive read-through |
| **APP** | AppLovin | Not on watchlist | EPS est. $2.93, Rev $1.61B | AI advertising/monetization proxy |

**ALB is the most important after-close report for the watchlist.** As the world's largest lithium producer and a Tier 1 name in both critical minerals and energy storage theses, Albemarle's guidance on lithium prices, Kings Mountain restart, and cost restructuring will set sentiment for the entire lithium/EV battery chain (SQM, LAC, PLS.AX, FLNC, EOSE). Analysts expect a loss of -$0.49 to -$0.62 EPS on ~$1.35B revenue. The key question is whether lithium price recovery above $20K/tonne translates to improved forward guidance.

**CSCO after-close** is relevant as a networking spend datapoint. Street expects $15.0-15.2B revenue; any commentary on data center networking spend could affect ANET (Tier 1 AI Infra) sentiment.

## 5. Unusual Options Activity

**Note:** Specific watchlist-level options flow data was limited in pre-market searches. Key observations:

### Watchlist-Adjacent Activity Detected

- **STMicroelectronics (STM):** 16,658 call options traded on Feb 10 -- a **308% increase** vs. typical volume. STM is adjacent to the semiconductor thesis (analog/mixed-signal for industrial/automotive). Bullish signal for semiconductor demand breadth.

- **Lam Research (LRCX):** Large volume of **put options** detected on Feb 10. LRCX is semiconductor equipment; put activity could reflect hedging ahead of WFE capex guidance or sector rotation concerns.

### Expected Activity Today

- **VRT post-earnings:** Expect massive options volume today given the 15-23% move. Call activity likely surged on the breakout. Watch for whether institutional flow confirms the move or distributes into strength.

- **ALB pre-earnings:** Options implied volatility likely elevated heading into tonight's report. The lithium sector has been in recovery mode, and 2026 guidance will be the swing factor.

- **CSCO pre-earnings:** Options flow will reflect networking sector expectations; any read-through to ANET is notable.

### Broader Institutional Positioning

- Bank of America highlighted **NVDA, AVGO, LRCX, KLAC, ADI, and CDNS** as top semiconductor picks, forecasting the sector to surpass $1T in annual sales in 2026. Institutional positioning in AI semi names remains heavily long.

- Defense stocks (RTX, LMT, NOC) continue to see steady institutional accumulation via block trades rather than unusual options spikes, consistent with long-duration thesis positioning.

---

## Summary: What Matters Most Today

1. **VRT blowout earnings** (+252% order growth, $15B backlog) is the single most important watchlist data point. It validates the AI infrastructure power/cooling thesis and signals hyperscaler capex acceleration is real and intensifying. The backlog jump from $9.5B to $15B in one quarter is extraordinary.

2. **ALB after-close earnings** will set direction for the lithium/critical minerals complex. Kings Mountain restart timeline and 2026 lithium price guidance are the two key items.

3. **Jobs report surprise** (130K vs. 55K est.) is broadly positive for risk assets. Dow touched ATH. But the -898K benchmark revision adds complexity. Health care and social assistance drove nearly all gains.

4. **NXE CNSC hearing** (running this week through Feb 13) is the most important near-term uranium catalyst. Positive outcome greenlights the largest new uranium mine.

5. **Software sector weakness** -- an ETF tracking software giants fell 3.5% today, weighing on PANW (-1.5%), CRWD, and other cyber names. No stock-specific news; appears to be sector rotation out of software into cyclicals on the strong jobs data.

6. **CSCO after-close** provides networking spend data relevant to ANET thesis.

7. **Look-ahead:** PANW earnings Feb 17, IONQ Feb 25, RKLB Feb 26, NVDA Feb 26.
