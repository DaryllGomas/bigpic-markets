# BigPic Morning Brief

## Event Load: MEDIUM — Monday, March 2

Geopolitics dominates. U.S.-Iran military conflict (Operation Epic Fury) enters its third day with Khamenei reportedly dead. Oil spikes 8%+, defense names surge, and everything else sells off. ISM Manufacturing is the only major data release today — watch the Prices Paid component for inflation signal into an already stressed tape.

|---|---|---|---|
| S&P 500 Futures | 6,810 | -1.14% | Below Friday's 6,879 close |
| Nasdaq 100 Futures | 24,635 | -1.48% | Growth leading to downside |

| 2Y Yield | 3.420% | — | Prior close (FRED) |
| 30Y Yield | 4.633% | flat | Long end unmoved |
| 2s/10s Spread | +0.542% | — | Curve remains positively sloped |

| WTI Crude | 72.72 | +8.50% | Strait of Hormuz disruption fears |
| Brent Crude | 79.24 | +8.74% | Analysts modeling $100-120/bbl scenarios |
| Gold | 5,409 | +3.07% | Classic risk-off bid |

*Sources: Schwab, Stooq, FRED, CoinGecko*

The standout anomaly is bonds defying the safe-haven playbook — 10Y yields are flat despite a massive risk-off event. This suggests the market is pricing in inflationary pressure from the oil spike, offsetting the flight-to-quality bid. Gold and the dollar are absorbing the safe-haven flows instead.

## Overnight & Global Markets

| Market | Level | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Nikkei 225 | 58,057 | -1.35% |
| Hang Seng | 26,060 | -2.14% |
| DAX | 24,729 | -2.20% |
| CAC 40 | 8,418 | -1.90% |
| FTSE 100 | 10,777 | -1.22% |
| Kospi | 6,244 | +0.75% |
| Europe STOXX 50 (FEZ) | 67.15 | -2.04% |

**Asia:** Broad weakness with Hang Seng leading losses at -2.14% (z-score: -3.3, flagged anomaly). Kospi was the lone green market at +0.75%. Asian airline stocks were notably weak on oil/travel disruption fears.

**Europe:** Heavy selling across the continent. DAX -2.20% led the decline, with defense-exposed names likely providing partial offset within a broadly weaker tape. Energy sector outperforming within European indices.

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Event | Impact | Consensus | Prior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 14:45 | Final Manufacturing PMI | Low | Pending | 51.2 |
| 15:00 | **ISM Manufacturing PMI** | **High** | 51.7 | Pending |
| 15:00 | ISM Manufacturing Prices | Medium | 60.6 | Pending |

All releases are **pending**. ISM Manufacturing at 15:00 ET is the key number. Consensus expects a slight deceleration to 51.7 from 52.6 — still expansionary. Prices Paid consensus of 60.6 (vs. 59.0 prior) will get extra scrutiny with oil spiking. A hot print compounds the stagflation narrative; a miss would add recession fears to the geopolitical overhang.

| ASML | 1,405 | -3.12% | AI Infra | Tier 3 |
| PL | 23.41 | -3.02% | Space | **Tier 1** |

Oil surge on Strait of Hormuz supply disruption fears — Iran reportedly struck a Saudi oil refinery. Airlines (DAL -5.78%, NCLH -7.22%) hit on dual headwinds of oil costs and Middle East travel disruption. BRK.B weak after Buffett's final-quarter operating earnings fell ~30%.

## Market Context & Playbook

**VIX Regime:** Elevated at 23.51 (+18.38%). This is a sharp move from a sub-20 base into a regime that historically correlates with wider intraday ranges and mean-reversion opportunities. Not yet at panic levels (30+), but elevated enough to warrant reduced position sizing.

**SPY Trend:** Bearish. Futures at 6,810 vs. SMA200 at 654 on SPY (roughly ~6,540 on the index). Still above the 200-day, but the trend assessment is bearish and the tape is deteriorating.

**Today's Bias: Bearish with rotation.** The geopolitical overhang is real and not fully priced. The oil spike creates a stagflation narrative (growth slowing + inflation rising) that is one of the worst macro combinations for equities. However, the defense sector is providing a clear rotation bid.

**Key Levels to Watch:**
- S&P 500: 6,810 futures — watch whether the cash session finds buyers or sellers accelerate below Friday's 6,879 close
- WTI Crude: $72.72 — a move toward $80 would intensify the stagflation narrative; Morgan Stanley models bear-market-triggering levels above that
- VIX: 23.51 — a push above 25 signals further de-risking; a fade back below 22 would be constructive
- 10Y Yield: 3.962% — the lack of a safety bid in bonds is the most unusual signal; if yields rise alongside equity weakness, it's a distinctly negative signal

**Risk Factors:**
1. Iran conflict escalation — Trump warned war could last "weeks"; Strait of Hormuz chokepoint could push oil toward $100+
2. ISM data this afternoon — a hot Prices Paid print into an oil-shock environment would reinforce stagflation fears
3. Earnings gauntlet — CRWD (tomorrow) and AVGO (Wednesday) are high-stakes reports for the tech/AI narrative
4. NFP later this week — labor market data lands into a deteriorating macro backdrop
5. Bond market dislocation — yields refusing to rally on risk-off is an amber warning for equity bulls
