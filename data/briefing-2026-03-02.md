## Market Intelligence (Opus Feed Analysis)

### Sector Themes
- **Energy / Oil & Gas:** Oil surges 6-7%+ as Iran conflict threatens Strait of Hormuz chokepoint; analysts model paths to $100-$120/bbl; potential 1970s-style energy shock if Hormuz closure is prolonged; gasoil spiking even more than crude

- **Crypto / Digital Assets:** Bitcoin under heavy pressure, slipping below $66K as oil spikes and risk-off dominates; $9B+ in ETF outflows over four months; SpaceX bitcoin holdings down ~30%; however, some analysts see a market bottom forming relative to gold, and institutional interest persists
- **Airlines / Travel:** Asia and global airline stocks drop sharply as Iran conflict escalates, oil costs surge, and Middle East uncertainty disrupts travel sentiment
- **Cybersecurity:** APT28 tied to actively exploited MSHTML zero-day (CVE-2026-21513); North Korean hackers distribute malicious npm packages with C2 infrastructure; Iran's internet down for second day amid reported U.S.-Israel cyberattacks
- **Critical Minerals & Mining:** USA Rare Earth highlighted for securing U.S. AI tech supply chain; mining deals in Canada, Argentina, and Utah signal continued consolidation; AI-driven electric trucks deployed in Chinese coal mining
- **Semiconductors / Hardware:** AMD details Ryzen AI 400 desktop APUs; Lenovo unveils modular AI PC concept and foldable gaming handheld; living neuron chip demonstrated playing Doom; Windows 11 nears 75% share
- **EVs / Clean Energy:** NIO deliveries rise 58% in February; XPENG deliveries down significantly; VinFast expanding dealer network; Subaru EV reviews; hydrogen economics questioned in Düren case study
- **Quantum Computing:** Fermilab and MIT advance ion-trap control; Monarch Quantum to supply photonics for NASA quantum gravity mission; Chicago region positioned as quantum hub
- **Space:** Space Force rethinks satellite ground strategy and opens tracking to commercial firms; ESA announces 100M euro satellite-mobile convergence initiative; NASA outlines Mars communications orbiter objectives

### Economic Context
- U.S. Jobs Report (NFP) (pending): Scheduled for the week ahead; labor market described as weakened with one 'silver lining'
- Inflation Data (pending): S&P 500 futures sliding on inflation jitters compounded by geopolitical risks

### Overall Sentiment
Sharply risk-off as U.S.-Iran military conflict and Khamenei's death drive oil above 7%, sink equity futures, pummel airlines and crypto, and lift defense and energy names — markets pricing in prolonged geopolitical disruption with recession fears compounding
