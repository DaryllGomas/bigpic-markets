### Economic Context
- FOMC Minutes (January 27-28 meeting) (released): Fed officials split on rate path; minutes mention possible rate hike, rattling markets
- Oil prices (released): Global oil benchmark hits 6-month high on U.S.-Iran conflict fears

### Fed Signals
- FOMC minutes released: Fed officials split on where interest rates should go, with some discussion of a possible rate hike
- Fed minutes triggered risk-off move: Bitcoin sank to $66K and U.S. stocks lost steam on hawkish tone

### Overall Sentiment
Risk-off tone dominates as hawkish FOMC minutes mentioning possible rate hikes collide with U.S.-Iran geopolitical fears driving oil to 6-month highs, while Walmart's weak guidance and Bitcoin's longest losing streak since 2022 underscore fragility — partially offset by pockets of tech strength in Figma, Cadence, and DoorDash, plus gold surging above $5,000 on safe-haven flows.
