*Point-in-time snapshot as of Sunday, March 1, 2026. Crypto trades 24/7 — prices reflect current levels, not Friday close.*

## Bitcoin

**Current Price: ~$68,000** | Weekly Range: $63,000 - $69,500 | BTC Dominance: ~57%

Bitcoin closed February at approximately $66,500, marking a **fifth consecutive monthly decline** from the October 2025 peak of ~$126,000 — a drawdown of roughly 47%. February's monthly loss was approximately 13.5%. Year-to-date, BTC is down ~27%.

**Weekly price action (Feb 24-28):** The week started poorly, with BTC sliding below $63,000 on Monday as tariff escalation fears and hot PPI data reinforced risk-off positioning. A midweek bounce carried prices back toward $70,000 on Wednesday (first time above $69K since Feb 16), driven by a broad risk-asset rally. However, the NVIDIA earnings pullback on Thursday/Friday erased gains, pushing BTC back below $66,000 by Friday's close. The week was essentially flat-to-slightly-positive for BTC despite violent intra-week swings.

**Weekend action (critical):** U.S.-Israeli airstrikes on Iran, including the confirmed killing of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, triggered a flash crash to $63,000 on Saturday. BTC then staged a sharp reversal, rallying back above $68,000 on Sunday as markets interpreted the leadership decapitation as raising odds of a shorter conflict. The swing from Saturday low to Sunday high was approximately $5,000 (8%).

**Key Levels:**
- **Support:** $66,500 (50% Fibonacci), $63,000 (Saturday war-shock low, now validated demand zone)
- **Resistance:** $68,300-$68,700 (first major resistance cluster), $70,000 (psychological / weekly high)
- **Structure:** Neutral-to-bearish macro trend. Five monthly red candles. Still in a confirmed downtrend from October highs.

**Total crypto market cap:** ~$2.33 trillion (-21% year-over-year). U.S. government holds ~328,000 BTC in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, established by executive order in March 2025, though active accumulation policy remains in legal limbo.

## Ethereum

**Current Price: ~$2,000** | Weekly Range: $1,750 - $2,100 | Market Cap: ~$243B

ETH continues to underperform BTC on a relative basis, though it showed stronger weekend recovery momentum. After dropping as low as ~$1,750 during Saturday's geopolitical shock, ETH surged 7.5% on Sunday to reclaim the $2,000 level. The ETH/BTC ratio remains depressed, reflecting the persistent rotation out of altcoins toward Bitcoin during macro stress.

**Key developments:**
- **Fusaka/Glamsterdam upgrade** (next major Ethereum hard fork) is targeted for Q2/Q3 2026, building on Pectra's foundation with full danksharding and increased data capacity. This remains the next major protocol catalyst.
- **Staking:** Post-Pectra, validators can now stake between 32 and 2,048 ETH per validator (EIP-7251), simplifying operations for large stakers.
- **DeFi activity on Ethereum:** Stablecoin market cap on Ethereum reached $171B as of late 2025 data. Ethereum remains the dominant settlement layer for DeFi despite L2 migration trends.

**Key Levels:**
- **Support:** $1,750 (weekend low, must hold), $1,700 (round number / psychological)
- **Resistance:** $2,100 (weekly high), $2,400 (prior consolidation zone)

## Altcoins & DeFi

**Altcoin performance (weekend recovery):** Altcoins broadly outperformed BTC on the Sunday recovery rally:
- **SOL:** +10.8% to ~$86 (leading the rebound) — down sharply from Dec 2024 ATH of $264
- **ADA:** +6.7%
- **DOGE:** +6.5%
- **XRP:** +5.6%
- **BNB:** +4.8%
- **AVAX:** Trading near ~$8.50 — under severe pressure, down from cycle highs

**DeFi Milestones:**
- **Aave** crossed $1 trillion in cumulative lending volume on Feb 25 — a historic first for any DeFi protocol. Current TVL: $27.2B. Generated $83.3M in fees over the past 30 days (4x its closest competitor). Aave Horizon (launched Aug 2025) is attracting institutional participants including VanEck, WisdomTree, and Securitize for RWA-backed borrowing.
- **Uniswap** governance voted to expand the fee switch to 8 additional L2 networks (Arbitrum, Base, Celo, OP Mainnet, Soneium, X Layer, Worldchain, Zora). UNI jumped 15% on the news. Estimated impact: ~$27M in additional annual revenue, bringing total protocol revenue to ~$60M/year. The proposal also includes a 100M UNI token burn mechanism.
- **Total DeFi TVL:** ~$105-130B range (down from $120B earlier in February during the broader selloff, but holding up relatively well vs. spot price declines). DeFi TVL has shown quiet strength — yield-seeking capital is sticky.

**Stablecoin market cap:** Ethereum stablecoin market cap reached $171B (late 2025). Stablecoin adoption continues expanding as core DeFi infrastructure. Cardano saw USDCx stablecoin launch, expanding multi-chain stablecoin footprint.

**Notable protocol news:**
- **Magic Eden** will sunset Bitcoin and EVM NFT marketplaces in early March and wind down its multi-chain wallet by early April — another sign the NFT market continues contracting.
- **MetaMask Card** fully launched across all 50 U.S. states with metal card and on-chain cashback.

## ETF Flows

### Bitcoin ETFs

The flow picture was net positive for the week, though it ended on a weak note:

| Period | Flow | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Feb 24-26 (3-day streak) | **+$1.1B net inflow** | IBIT alone: +$652M. Strongest weekly pace since mid-January. |
| Feb 27 (Friday) | **-$27.5M net outflow** | Snapped the streak. IBIT: -$33M. Risk-off into weekend. |
| **IBIT cumulative** | **$61.8B total net inflows** | Remains the dominant product by a wide margin. |

Despite BTC being down ~47% from October highs, ETF flows have **not** signaled "crypto winter" panic. Outflows have been measured, not capitulatory. Per CNBC: "Flows are down but aren't signaling investor panic." This is a significant divergence from price action — institutional holders appear to be maintaining positions through the drawdown.

### Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum ETF flows were more volatile and net negative for February:

| Date | ETHA Flow | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Feb 5 | -$59M | 0.83% of AUM ($7.1B at the time) |
| Feb 24 | -$45M | 0.78% of AUM (~$5.8B) |
| Feb 26 | +$15.3M | Led all ETH ETFs; $500M daily volume |
| Feb 27 | -$43M (total ETH ETFs) | ETHA accounted for entire outflow |

**ETHA AUM:** ~$5.8B (down from $7.1B earlier in the month, reflecting both outflows and price decline). Ethereum ETFs are seeing more conviction-testing outflows than their Bitcoin counterparts, consistent with ETH's weaker relative performance.

## Regulation & Institutional

**SEC "Project Crypto" — Major Policy Reset:**
SEC Chair Paul Atkins (who replaced Gensler) is executing a dramatic pivot in crypto regulatory posture:
- Announced **"Project Crypto"** — a joint SEC/CFTC initiative to modernize digital asset oversight
- Developing a **token taxonomy** to clearly delineate securities from non-securities
- Pushing an **"innovation exemption"** to fast-track crypto product approvals
- **Sanctioned tokenized money market mutual funds** — a concrete step toward TradFi-crypto convergence
- Atkins will speak at **Bitcoin 2026 Conference** — first sitting SEC Chair to attend
- Multiple enforcement cases from the Gensler era have been withdrawn or paused, though the Justin Sun/Tron case remains contentious (Atkins grilled by Democrats on enforcement pullback)

**U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve:**
- The reserve (established by EO in March 2025) holds ~328,000 BTC from forfeiture
- BITCOIN Act legislation is in Congress, requiring a 20-year minimum holding period
- Active accumulation remains stalled on "obscure legal provisions" per White House digital assets advisor Patrick Witt
- Led by Texas and New Hampshire, U.S. states are racing to put Bitcoin on public balance sheets
- Brazil reintroduced legislation in Feb 2026 proposing a national Bitcoin reserve (RESBit) targeting 1M BTC over 5 years

**Crypto Security:**
- February 2026 saw a **98% year-over-year drop** in hack losses — a dramatic improvement from the $1.4B Bybit hack (Feb 2025) era. Industry security practices have materially improved.

**Other institutional signals:**
- Jane Street scrutiny: After being sued over alleged market manipulation, the recurring "10 AM Bitcoin dump" pattern disappeared
- Netherlands plans to amend controversial unrealized crypto gains tax bill

## Weekend Developments

### U.S.-Israeli Strikes on Iran — Geopolitical Shock Event

This is the dominant market story heading into the new trading week.

**Timeline:**
- **Saturday, March 1:** U.S. and Israeli forces launched a massive military campaign against Iran. Multiple waves of airstrikes hit Iranian military and nuclear infrastructure.
- **Saturday:** Iranian state media confirmed the death of **Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei** (age 86) in the strikes. Iran retaliated with strikes targeting U.S. bases in the region and Israel.
- **Sunday:** Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel — first since the November 2024 ceasefire.

**Crypto Market Impact:**
1. **Initial crash:** BTC plunged to $63,000 on Saturday during the strikes — a ~$3,000 drop in hours
2. **Relief rally:** BTC reversed sharply, reclaiming $68,000 on Sunday (+8% from lows) as markets interpreted the leadership decapitation as potentially shortening the conflict
3. **Liquidations:** ~$645M in 24-hour crypto liquidations, with **shorts comprising the largest share** — a powerful short squeeze on the reversal
4. **Altcoin recovery:** SOL +10.8%, ETH +7.5%, ADA +6.7%, DOGE +6.5%, XRP +5.6%
5. **Total market cap** recovered above $2.34T, up ~3.2% on Sunday

**Analysis:** The crypto market's reaction pattern — sharp sell-off on the strike, followed by rapid recovery on regime change confirmation — is consistent with crypto's evolution as a macro risk asset. The speed of recovery suggests the market is betting on de-escalation following leadership change, though the Hezbollah rocket fire introduces counter-escalation risk. Weekend liquidity was thin, amplifying moves in both directions.

**Key risk for Monday:** If the conflict escalates further (particularly if Iran's military responds with more strikes), the $63,000 level could be retested. If markets interpret this as a contained event trending toward de-escalation, the $68,000+ level should hold. Oil prices and traditional safe-haven flows (gold, treasuries) will be the guide.
