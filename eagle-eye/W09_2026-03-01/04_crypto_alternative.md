# Crypto & Alternative — Week Ending 2026-02-27

## Bitcoin

**Price:** $67,958 | **Weekly Change:** +0.6% | **Dominance:** 58.3%

Bitcoin ended Week 9 essentially flat, eking out a marginal +0.6% weekly gain amid extreme intra-week volatility. The week opened near $67,950 on Feb 21, plunged to $64,108 on Feb 24 as the broader risk-off mood intensified, then staged a sharp rebound to $68,489 on Feb 25 before sliding back toward $66,000 on Friday as Nvidia earnings disappointment rippled through risk assets. BTC closed the week near $67,958.

**Context within the larger correction:** Bitcoin remains approximately 46% below its October 2025 all-time high of $126,296. The drawdown — driven by the US-China trade war escalation (100% tariffs on Chinese tech exports), macro uncertainty, and the broader risk-off environment — has brought BTC to levels not seen since early 2025. The 47-50% drawdown is consistent with prior cycle corrections that have historically preceded new all-time highs.

**Key Technical Levels:**
- **Support:** $65,000 (principal), $64,399, $62,467, $60,000 (major structural)
- **Resistance:** $68,800 (near-term), $72,000-$72,500 (key zone, 61.8% Fibonacci retracement), $73,300, $74,750
- **RSI:** 37.34 — oversold territory, historically a strong bounce zone (15-20% rallies from similar levels in Q4 2025)

**Dominance:** BTC.D peaked at 61% on Feb 24 before rolling over to ~58.3% by week-end. The peak-and-reversal above 60% is significant — the last time this pattern occurred was November 2020, preceding the most explosive altcoin season in crypto history. However, the current environment (deep correction, macro headwinds) makes a repeat less certain.

**On-Chain Highlights:** Bitcoin ETF investors displayed "diamond hands" behavior — only $6.5B in cumulative outflows since the October 2025 ATH despite a 47% price decline, indicating strong conviction among institutional holders. MicroStrategy (now Strategy Inc.) continued accumulating, adding 592 BTC ($39.8M) between Feb 17-22 at an average cost of $67,286, bringing total holdings to 717,722 BTC ($47.6B cost basis, avg $66,385/BTC).

**Narrative:** Bitcoin is in a consolidation/bottoming phase. The $65,000-$73,300 range appears to be the battleground. A break above $72,500 would signal recovery toward $75,000+; a break below $65,000 opens the door to $60,000. The oversold RSI and ETF flow reversal (see below) provide cautious optimism for a near-term bounce. JPMorgan noted that pending market-structure legislation (the Clarity Act) could be "the ultimate spark" for a sustained recovery.

## Ethereum

**Price:** $1,947 | **Weekly Change:** ~-4% | **ETH/BTC:** 0.0300

Ethereum underperformed Bitcoin meaningfully this week, declining approximately 4% to close near $1,947. ETH has now fallen roughly 35% over the past month, significantly worse than Bitcoin's drawdown, reflecting the broader risk-off rotation away from altcoins and into BTC.

**ETH/BTC Ratio:** The ETH/BTC ratio sits at 0.0300 — near multi-year lows and well below the 0.08+ levels seen in 2021-2022. This ratio has been in a persistent downtrend since the Merge in September 2022, driven by: (1) Ethereum's relative underperformance in the current cycle, (2) competition from Solana and L2s cannibalizing ETH fee revenue, and (3) the narrative shift toward Bitcoin as institutional-grade "digital gold."

**Key Technical Levels:**
- **Support:** $1,900, $1,750, $1,600
- **Resistance:** $2,100, $2,300, $2,500

**Ecosystem Developments:**
- The Pectra upgrade (activated May 2025) continues to reshape staking dynamics — validators can now stake up to 2,048 ETH per validator (up from 32 ETH), reducing operational complexity for institutions. Deposit activation times dropped from ~13 hours to 13 minutes.
- Ethereum L2 total TVL surpassed $50B for the first time — a historic milestone demonstrating scaling solution traction, even as base-layer ETH struggles.
- Ethereum still commands approximately 68% of total DeFi TVL (~$62B of ~$92B total), though its share is gradually declining as Solana, Base, and other chains gain ground.

**Thesis Connection:** Ethereum's weakness is notable given the AI infrastructure thesis — ETH underpins much of the decentralized compute and AI token ecosystem. The persistent ETH/BTC ratio decline raises questions about whether Ethereum's value capture model is structurally impaired, or whether this represents a generational entry point for the dominant smart contract platform.

## Altcoins & DeFi

### Notable Altcoin Moves

| Token | Price (Feb 27) | Weekly % | Notes |
|-------|---------------|----------|-------|
| SOL | $78.35 | ~-5% | Down 31% YTD; TVL at 80M SOL ATH despite price weakness |
| AVAX | $9.28 | ~-8% | Testing multi-year lows; weak relative performance |
| LINK | $8.98 | ~-6% | Broadly in line with alt weakness |
| ADA | $0.268 | ~-7% | Near cycle lows |
| DOT | $1.31 | ~-9% | Testing all-time lows near $1.20 |
| POL | $0.107 | ~-5% | Polygon surpassed ETH in daily fees briefly in Feb; on-chain strong, price weak |
| XRP | — | -3.5% (Fri) | Biggest loser among majors on Feb 27 |

**Memecoins:** PEPE dropped 4.95% and BONK fell 4.87% on Friday alone, reflecting continued rotation out of speculative assets.

**AI Tokens:** The AI crypto sector showed relative resilience amid the broader downturn:
- **TAO (Bittensor):** ~$191, up 26.4% over prior 7 days — outperforming the broader market significantly on decentralized AI compute narrative
- **FET (Fetch.ai / ASI Alliance):** $0.288, showing 17% monthly gains
- **RENDER:** Saw 37% weekly gains earlier in the month on growing interest in GPU rendering infrastructure

The AI token outperformance connects directly to our AI infrastructure thesis — decentralized compute and AI-specific blockchain infrastructure are benefiting from the same hyperscaler capex narrative, offering crypto-native exposure to the $650B AI spending cycle.

### DeFi TVL

Total DeFi TVL declined to approximately $91.8B by month-end, down from $120B in early February — a sharp 23% drawdown driven by falling token prices rather than meaningful capital flight. Key protocol TVLs:

| Protocol | TVL | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Lido | ~$27.5B | Largest DeFi protocol; ETH liquid staking dominant |
| Aave | ~$27B | Lending leader; resilient through volatility |
| EigenLayer | ~$13B | Restaking; significant but declining from highs |
| Uniswap | ~$6.8B | DEX leader |
| Maker | ~$5.2B | Stablecoin/lending backbone |

**Chain Breakdown:**
- **Ethereum:** ~$62B TVL (~68% of total)
- **Solana:** ~$9.2B TVL (80M SOL ATH, rivaling the entire top-tier L2 basket at $9.05B)
- **Ethereum L2s combined:** ~$50B+ (historic milestone)

**Key observation:** DeFi TVL has shown "quiet strength" — while dollar-denominated TVL fell with prices, token-denominated TVL (especially on Solana) hit all-time highs, indicating that DeFi users are maintaining or increasing positions through the drawdown. This is a resilience signal.

### Stablecoin Market

Total stablecoin market cap: **~$300-$317B**

| Stablecoin | Market Cap | Change | Share |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| USDT | $183.6B | -0.8% MoM | 60.6% |
| USDC | $75.3B | +72% YoY | 24.9% |
| Others | ~$41-$58B | — | ~14.5% |

**Key development:** USDT saw its second consecutive month of contraction — the first back-to-back monthly decline since the Terra/LUNA collapse in 2022. Approximately $3B in USDT supply has exited circulation over two months. In contrast, USDC surged 72% YoY to $75.3B, and Circle's Q4 earnings sent its stock up 16%. USDC now leads Binance spot trading volume ($1.6B daily), outpacing BTC pairs ($1.4B). The USDT/USDC divergence may reflect regulatory tailwinds favoring Circle's compliance-first approach and growing institutional preference for regulated stablecoins.

World Liberty Financial's USD1 stablecoin expanded market value by roughly 50% in early 2026, highlighting new competitive dynamics in the stablecoin market.

## ETF Flows

### Bitcoin ETFs — Week Ending Feb 27

Bitcoin spot ETFs posted **$787.3M in net inflows** for the week — the first positive week since late January and a dramatic reversal from the prior week's $315.9M in outflows. This broke a five-week outflow streak.

| Day | Net Flow |
|-----|----------|
| Feb 23 (Mon) | -$203.8M |
| Feb 24 (Tue) | +$257.7M |
| Feb 25 (Wed) | +$506.5M |
| Feb 26 (Thu) | +$254.5M |
| Feb 27 (Fri) | -$27.6M |
| **Week Total** | **+$787.3M** |

**Fund-Level Breakdown (Feb 26 data):**
- **IBIT (BlackRock):** +$275.8M (dominant inflow leader)
- **BITB (Bitwise):** +$69M
- **FBTC (Fidelity):** -$51.5M (mixed, with some days positive)
- **ARKB (ARK/21Shares):** -$44.9M
- **GBTC (Grayscale):** $0 (flat)

**Cumulative AUM:** Total Bitcoin spot ETF AUM stands at approximately $834B with $54.8B in cumulative net inflows since January 2024. However, YTD 2026 flows remain negative at approximately -$4.5B, reflecting the sustained correction from ATH.

**Key Holdings:**
- IBIT: ~$75B AUM (largest Bitcoin ETF globally)
- FBTC: >$20B AUM
- All spot Bitcoin ETFs combined: ~$130B AUM

### Ethereum ETFs — Week Ending Feb 27

Ethereum ETFs saw a **flow reversal** in the final week of February, recording $157M in net inflows on Feb 25 alone — breaking a five-week outflow streak. However, the full month of February was deeply negative.

**February Monthly Summary:**
- Weeks 1-3: Persistent outflows totaling approximately $280M
- Week 4 (ending Feb 27): Reversal to positive territory
- ETHA (BlackRock): Dominant driver of both outflows and inflows; hit $500M daily volume on Feb 25, signaling strong institutional participation

The ETH ETF flow picture remains structurally weaker than Bitcoin ETFs, consistent with the broader ETH/BTC underperformance narrative.

## Regulation & Institutional

### SEC/CFTC Harmonization — Landmark Shift

The most significant regulatory development of 2026 occurred on January 29 when CFTC Chairman Michael Selig and SEC Chairman Paul Atkins jointly announced **"Project Crypto"** — a coordinated approach to digital asset regulation that marks a clear pivot away from the enforcement-driven posture of prior years.

**Key elements:**
- **Taxonomy framework:** Digital commodities, digital collectibles, and digital "tools" will NOT be treated as securities "even when sold as part of an investment contract" — a direct repudiation of the Gensler-era approach
- **Joint codification:** CFTC and SEC staff directed to consider joint interim codification of this taxonomy while Congress finalizes legislation
- **SEC tokenized securities statement (Jan 28):** Division of Corporation Finance, Division of Investment Management, and Division of Trading and Markets issued a basic taxonomy of tokenized securities
- **Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act:** Advanced out of Senate Agriculture Committee on January 29; industry experts estimate 50-60% probability of passage before November 2026 midterms

JPMorgan stated the long-awaited Clarity Act would "boost institutional participation and accelerate tokenization across U.S. crypto markets."

### Legislative Pipeline

Top bills to watch in 2026:
1. **Market Structure Bill (Clarity Act):** Defines SEC vs. CFTC jurisdiction over digital assets
2. **Stablecoin legislation:** Framework for stablecoin issuance and reserves
3. **Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act:** CFTC oversight of crypto spot markets

### Institutional Adoption

**Corporate Treasury:** At least 172 publicly traded companies now hold Bitcoin (up 40% QoQ as of Q3 2025), collectively holding approximately 1 million BTC (~5% of circulating supply). Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy) remains the largest corporate holder at 717,722 BTC ($47.6B cost basis).

**MSCI Index Inclusion:** MSCI approved a framework for Bitcoin treasury companies to be included in major equity indices, providing fiduciary cover for institutional allocators — a potentially significant catalyst for further corporate adoption.

**ETF Ecosystem:** Combined spot Bitcoin ETF AUM exceeds $130B. Despite the 47% price correction, total cumulative inflows remain at $54.8B — institutions have not materially de-risked, suggesting strong conviction in the long-term thesis.

**Stablecoins as Infrastructure:** Silicon Valley Bank's 2026 outlook highlighted stablecoins poised to become "the internet's dollar," with growing enterprise adoption for payments, cross-border settlement, and treasury operations. Circle's 72% YoY USDC growth validates this trend.

### Security Landscape

Crypto security improved dramatically in February 2026, with hack losses down 98% YoY — a significant improvement from the February 2025 Bybit hack ($1.5B, the largest crypto theft in history, attributed to North Korea's Lazarus Group). The industry has implemented stronger cold wallet procedures, multi-party computation signing, and real-time monitoring in response.

### Thesis Connections

**AI x Crypto:** The AI token sector (TAO, FET, RENDER) is the most direct crypto-native exposure to our AI infrastructure thesis. Decentralized GPU rendering (RENDER), decentralized AI training (TAO/Bittensor), and AI agent infrastructure (FET) benefit from the same $650B hyperscaler capex cycle driving NVDA, TSM, and AVGO. The AI token basket has outperformed the broader crypto market in February, suggesting narrative resilience.

**Quantum Risk:** Per our quantum thesis, approximately $718B in Bitcoin sits in quantum-vulnerable addresses (P2PK). BIP-360 (quantum-resistant Bitcoin upgrade) could take 5-10 years to implement. While CRQC threat remains 4-8 years out, PQC migration in traditional finance creates awareness that will eventually force crypto protocols to address this vulnerability.

**Energy/Mining:** Bitcoin mining's energy footprint continues to intersect with our nuclear and energy storage theses. Several mining operators have signed PPAs with nuclear facilities, and grid-scale battery storage is being co-located with mining operations to monetize curtailed renewable energy.
