## CRITICAL: Weekend Developments -- U.S.-Israel Strikes on Iran

**This is the single most important development for Monday's open.** On Saturday, February 28, the United States and Israel launched a joint military operation against Iran -- codenamed "Operation Epic Fury" (U.S.) and "Roaring Lion" (Israel). The strikes killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and hit over 1,000 targets across Iran including IRGC command-and-control centers, missile sites, submarines, and communications infrastructure. Three American troops have been killed, with President Trump acknowledging more casualties are "likely."

**Iran has retaliated** with an unprecedented wave of strikes across the Middle East, targeting countries hosting U.S. military bases and Israel. Hezbollah fired rockets at northern Israel for the first time since the November 2024 ceasefire. Iran has effectively closed the Strait of Hormuz -- while not physically blockaded, insurance withdrawal for commercial shipping has achieved the same result.

**Sunday night futures (as of 6 PM ET open):**
- **Dow futures:** Down ~500 points (-1.0%)
- **S&P 500 futures:** Down ~1.0%
- **Nasdaq 100 futures:** Down ~1.0%
- **Brent crude:** Surging ~13% to ~$80/bbl (from Friday's ~$73)
- **WTI crude:** ~$73, up sharply
- **Gold:** Up ~2%, flight to safety
- **Dollar:** Surging as safe-haven bid

**Strait of Hormuz risk:** Approximately 20% of global oil supply transits this chokepoint daily. Analysts estimate a sustained closure could push oil above $100/bbl. OPEC+ raised its production quota by 220,000 bpd on Sunday but cannot offset a full Hormuz disruption -- 3.5M bpd of spare capacity is concentrated in Saudi Arabia and UAE, much of which also depends on Strait access. Brent is expected to open Monday in the $85-90 range, with potential intraday spike above $88.

**Market implications:** Expect a sharp rotation into defense (LMT, RTX, NOC, LHX), energy (XOM, CVX, XLE), and gold. Risk-off rotation out of high-beta tech, small-caps, and speculative growth. This event compounds an already weak February for equities and could define the macro backdrop for weeks.

## Market Overview

### Weekly Index Performance (Week ending Feb 27, 2026)

| Index | Friday Close | Weekly Change | February Change | YTD |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| **S&P 500** | 5,954.50 | -0.4% | Worst month since Mar 2025 | ~+0.5% |
| **Nasdaq Composite** | 18,847.28 | -1.0% est. | Worst month since Mar 2025 | ~-2.5% |
| **Dow Jones** | 43,840.91 | -1.1% | Significant decline | Slightly negative |
| **Russell 2000** | -- | -1.9% (Friday alone) | Underperforming after Jan rally | ~+6.7% (mid-Feb) |

**February was brutal for risk assets.** The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each posted their worst monthly performance since March 2025. The selloff was driven by three converging forces:

1. **AI spending skepticism:** Persistent angst about whether hundreds of billions in hyperscaler capex will generate adequate returns. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF fell 10% in February alone, with YTD losses reaching 23%.
2. **Hot inflation data:** Producer price index came in much hotter than expected on Friday, adding sticky inflation fears to an already fragile sentiment backdrop.
3. **Rotation out of tech:** Energy, materials, and consumer staples led the S&P 500 YTD while technology lagged significantly.

The VIX closed at 19.86 on February 27 after declining from earlier spikes. However, the Iran crisis will almost certainly push VIX sharply higher at Monday's open. The put/call ratio hit a seasonal high of 1.25 on February 25, reflecting extreme defensiveness before the geopolitical shock even materialized.

## Sector Performance

### Weekly Sector Snapshot

| Sector | ETF | Weekly Trend | February Trend | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Technology** | XLK | Down ~1.7% | Worst performer in Feb | AI skepticism, software selloff, valuation reset |
| **Financials** | XLF | Down ~2.1% | Sharp monthly decline | Hot inflation data raises rate uncertainty |
| **Energy** | XLE | Modest | YTD leader | Iran crisis massively bullish for energy Monday |
| **Materials** | XLB | Outperforming | YTD leader | Critical minerals, copper strength |
| **Consumer Staples** | XLP | Outperforming | YTD leader | Defensive rotation beneficiary |
| **Utilities** | XLU | Outperforming | Data center demand | CEG, Southern Co raising capex for DC demand |
| **Healthcare** | XLV | Mixed | -- | Defensive but not leading |
| **Industrials** | XLI | Mixed | -- | Defense sub-sector will benefit from Iran |
| **Communication Services** | XLC | Weak | Dragged by tech adjacency | -- |
| **Real Estate** | XLRE | Mixed | Rate sensitive | -- |

**Key rotation theme:** The great rotation away from mega-cap tech and into value, energy, materials, and staples continued throughout February. This is a meaningful shift in market character from the AI-driven leadership of 2024-2025. The Iran crisis will accelerate this rotation dramatically at the Monday open.

## Earnings

### Major Reports -- Week of February 24-27, 2026

**NVIDIA (NVDA) -- Q4 FY2026 (reported Feb 25)**
The defining earnings report of the week. NVIDIA delivered a massive beat:
- **Revenue:** $68.1B (vs. $66.2B consensus) -- up 73% YoY, 20% QoQ
- **Data Center:** $62.3B -- up 75% YoY (Morgan Stanley called it "the largest and cleanest beat in semis history")
- **GAAP Gross Margin:** 75% (beat guidance, up from 73.4% in Q3)
- **Q1 FY2027 Guidance:** $78.0B +/-2% (vs. $72.8B consensus) -- a massive upside guide
- **Full Year FY2026:** $215.9B revenue, up 65% YoY
- **Stock reaction:** Popped 3%+ after hours, but the broader market failed to sustain the rally as AI spending skepticism persisted. NVDA closed the week at $177.19.

Despite the blowout numbers, the market's muted response reflects a maturing narrative -- NVIDIA is delivering, but investors are increasingly questioning the downstream monetization of this infrastructure spend.

**Other notable reports:**
- **Keysight Technologies (KEYS):** Missed Q1 EPS ($1.79 vs. $1.99 consensus) but raised FY2026 guidance to $8.59 EPS (vs. $7.75 consensus), sending shares sharply higher after hours.
- **Duolingo (DUOL):** Beat Q4 expectations but issued disappointing 2026 guidance -- shares plunged 25% pre-market Friday.
- **Flutter Entertainment (FLUT):** Missed revenue ($4.74B vs. $4.93B consensus) -- shares fell 12% pre-market Friday.

## Breadth & Sentiment

| Indicator | Value/Status | Signal |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **VIX** | 19.86 (Feb 27 close) | Elevated but declining mid-week; Iran crisis will spike this Monday |
| **Put/Call Ratio** | 1.25 (Feb 25 high) | Extreme defensiveness -- highest seasonal reading |
| **S&P 500 % Above 200-DMA** | ~65% (est. late Feb) | Down from >65% in Jan; breadth deteriorating |
| **Advance/Decline** | Weakening | February saw persistent selling pressure under the surface |
| **Fear & Greed** | Shifting toward Fear | AI anxiety + inflation + now geopolitical crisis |
| **February Monthly Performance** | S&P worst month since Mar 2025 | Nasdaq worst month since Mar 2025 |

**Breadth assessment:** Market internals deteriorated throughout February as the tech-led selloff broadened. The advance/decline line weakened, with fewer stocks participating in rallies. The percentage of S&P 500 members above their 200-day moving average declined from over 65% in early January. The Iran crisis adds a geopolitical risk premium that will further pressure breadth as investors flee to safety assets and defensive sectors.

**Calendar context (from CALENDAR.md):** We are approaching the March 17-20 convergence window -- FOMC meeting (Mar 18, SEP with first 2026 dot plot), Triple Witch (Mar 20), and S&P Rebalance (Mar 20). CME pricing shows 60% probability of a hold and 38% of a cut at the March meeting. Three rate cuts (75 bps) remain priced by year-end. The Iran crisis could accelerate cut expectations if it triggers a growth scare. Midterm year (Year 2 of presidential cycle) historically front-loads weakness in H1 -- this pattern is playing out.

## Key Themes for the Week Ahead (March 2-6)

1. **Iran crisis dominance:** Monday's open will be defined by the geopolitical shock. Defense, energy, and gold will surge. Tech and risk assets will face selling pressure. Watch for Strait of Hormuz developments -- sustained closure is the nightmare scenario for oil markets ($100+ Brent).

2. **Rotation acceleration:** The Feb rotation out of tech/AI into value/energy/defense was already underway. Iran pours gasoline on this trade. Energy and materials stocks are now in a structural uptrend vs. tech.

3. **NVIDIA paradox:** Despite the cleanest earnings beat in semiconductor history, the market cannot sustain a tech rally. This speaks to the maturation of the AI narrative and growing investor focus on the "4% monetization problem" -- $600B+ infrastructure spend vs. ~$25B in AI service revenue.

4. **March FOMC preview (Mar 18):** First 2026 dot plot. Iran crisis could shift rate expectations if it triggers a growth scare via energy prices, or could keep the Fed hawkish if oil-driven inflation fears dominate.

5. **Artemis II (Mar 6):** NASA's crewed lunar mission launch is a near-term catalyst for space stocks (LUNR, RKLB, PL).

6. **Triple Witch convergence (Mar 20):** FOMC + Triple Witch + S&P Rebalance in the same week. Historically, positioning starts ~T-9 (March 9). The pre-expiration rally averages +0.82% from T-9 to T-1, but geopolitical risk could overwhelm seasonal patterns.
