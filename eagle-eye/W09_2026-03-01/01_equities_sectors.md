# Equities & Sectors -- Week Ending 2026-02-27

## Market Overview

U.S. equities ended the week lower as a convergence of hot inflation data, "AI fatigue," and geopolitical unease triggered a broad risk-off shift. Friday's session was the heaviest drag: the January PPI report showed wholesale inflation rising +0.5% MoM (vs. +0.3% expected), with core readings also above consensus, reinforcing concerns that sticky inflation could delay any Fed rate cuts. Meanwhile, investors continued to rotate out of high-multiple technology names on questions about AI monetization and competitive dynamics (Meta exploring AMD/Google chips, OpenAI turning to Amazon silicon).

| Index | Close (Feb 27) | Weekly Change | February Change | YTD 2026 |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| S&P 500 (SPX) | 6,878.88 | -0.4% | Negative | ~+0.9% |
| Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) | 22,668.21 | -0.9% | Negative | Approx. flat |
| DJIA | 48,977.92 | -1.05% (-521 pts) | Approx. flat | Approx. flat |
| Russell 2000 (IWM) | ~260.90 | -1.9% | Negative | Negative |
| Nasdaq-100 (NDX) | 24,960.04 | -0.3% | Negative | Approx. flat |

**Key weekly drivers:**
- **PPI surprise (Feb 27):** Wholesale inflation +0.5% MoM vs. +0.3% expected crushed Friday's session, dragging SPX down -0.4% and DJIA down -521 points on the final day alone.
- **NVIDIA earnings paradox:** Record Q4 revenue of $68.1B (+73% YoY) and $78B Q1 guide (vs. $72.8B est.) were not enough -- NVDA fell -5.5% on Feb 26 as concerns about customer concentration and hyperscaler capex sustainability weighed on sentiment.
- **AI fatigue rotation:** Investors pivoted from technology and growth into defensive sectors (utilities, staples, healthcare). Articles described it as "massive capital flight" from AI names.
- **Geopolitical unease:** Concerns about a potential U.S. military strike on Iran lifted crude oil and benefited energy names.
- **International outperformance:** MSCI World ex-US gained ~8% YTD vs. the S&P's ~0.9%, with European (STOXX 600 at record highs for 9th consecutive positive month) and Asian markets (Japan, Korea, Taiwan) significantly outperforming the U.S.

## Sector Performance

The week was defined by a decisive defensive rotation. Technology and banks led to the downside, while utilities, consumer staples, healthcare, and energy held up or gained. This pattern intensified through February and was described by multiple sources as "The Great Defensive Pivot."

| Sector ETF | Sector | Weekly Trend | February MTD | Commentary |
|-----------|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| XLK | Technology | Down | -1.6% MTD | AI fatigue dragged mega-cap tech; NVDA -5.5% post-earnings selloff, PANW weak on earnings miss, cybersecurity names hit by Anthropic tool launch |
| XLF | Financials | Down | +6.1% MTD | Weakened during the week on risk-off shift despite strong month; banks underperformed |
| XLV | Health Care | Up | +1.8% MTD | Defensive bid; one of the week's winners |
| XLU | Utilities | Up | +1.5% MTD | "Great Defensive Pivot" -- investors crowded into utilities for yield and AI-power-demand exposure |
| XLP | Consumer Staples | Up | Positive | Safe-haven flows; one of the better sectors alongside healthcare |
| XLE | Energy | Up | +1.6% MTD | Crude oil rose on Iran strike concerns; energy outperformed |
| XLI | Industrials | Mixed | +0.25% MTD | Defense-heavy names (LMT, RTX) held up; broader industrials mixed |
| XLC | Communication Svcs | Down | Negative | Dragged by tech-adjacent names; AI rotation headwind |
| XLY | Consumer Disc. | Down | Negative | Tesla -1.5% on Friday; broader discretionary weak |
| XLRE | Real Estate | Mixed | Mixed | Modest interest-rate sensitivity |
| XLB | Materials | Mixed | Mixed | Copper and lithium names showed resilience on structural deficit narratives |

**Rotation signal:** The shift from growth/tech into defensives (XLU, XLP, XLV) is the most pronounced since the 2022 drawdown. Seven of 11 sector ETFs recorded outflows during the week. Energy (XLE) saw the largest inflows. This rotation reflects a market re-pricing AI capex sustainability and inflation persistence.

## Breadth & Sentiment

### VIX & Volatility
- **VIX close (Feb 27):** 19.86, up +6.6% (+1.23 pts) on the day
- **Context:** Elevated relative to the sub-15 levels seen in late 2025, reflecting increased uncertainty around AI valuations, inflation persistence, and geopolitical risk. The VIX term structure remained in mild contango, suggesting traders are pricing near-term risk without extreme panic.

### Market Breadth
- **Advance/Decline:** Friday Feb 27 saw broad declines, with the Russell 2000 falling -1.9%, significantly underperforming large caps. Small caps have been the weakest cohort YTD, reflecting tightening financial conditions concerns.
- **New Highs/Lows:** European and Japanese indices (FTSE 100, STOXX 600, Nikkei 225) ended the week at or near record highs, while U.S. indices were well off their January peaks. The divergence between U.S. and international breadth was notable.
- **Rotation evidence:** The week saw 7 of 11 sector ETFs record net outflows. Flows concentrated into energy (XLE inflows) and treasuries (Bloomberg Treasury Index +1.5% MTD, best-performing fixed income sector).

### Sentiment Indicators
- **Put/Call Ratio:** The 10-day moving average of the CBOE total put/call ratio hovered around 0.90-0.95, in the middle of its three-year range -- neither signaling extreme fear nor complacency. Elevated but not at capitulation levels.
- **Treasury bid:** Treasuries as a safe-haven asset saw strong flows, confirming risk-off sentiment without panic.
- **AI fatigue as sentiment driver:** Multiple sources described a shift from "promise phase" to "proof phase" in AI investing. The NVIDIA sell-the-news reaction despite blowout earnings was the clearest expression of this sentiment reset.
