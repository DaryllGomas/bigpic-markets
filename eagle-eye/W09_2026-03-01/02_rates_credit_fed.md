# Rates, Credit & Fed -- Week Ending 2026-02-27

## Summary

Treasuries posted their best month in a year as a decisive risk-off rotation drove the 10-year yield below 4% for the first time since November 2025. The week's narrative was dominated by growing stagflation fears -- a hot January PPI reading (core +0.8% vs. +0.3% expected) collided with deteriorating growth signals, a 500+ point Dow selloff, and deepening concerns about AI-driven economic disruption. Safe-haven demand overwhelmed any residual hawkish repricing from the prior week's FOMC minutes, sending the 10-year down 11 bps on the week to 3.97% and the 2-year down 36 bps to 3.38% -- its lowest level since August 2022. The Bloomberg Treasury Index returned +1.5% for February, with long-duration bonds gaining 4%.

The Fed speaker calendar was busy: Governor Waller (Feb 23) called a March rate cut "a coin flip" contingent on February labor data, revealing that revised 2025 payroll data may show employment actually *fell* over the year -- an extraordinary revision. Chicago Fed President Goolsbee pushed back on cuts, saying 3% inflation "is not good enough." Boston Fed President Collins advocated patience, stating the Fed is "quite likely" to hold rates steady "for some time." Richmond's Barkin and St. Louis's Musalem both called current policy "well positioned." The net tone was moderately hawkish on the rate path, even as the bond market was aggressively pricing in economic weakness.

CME FedWatch continues to show 94% probability of a hold at the March 18 meeting. However, the market is increasingly pricing cuts further out: roughly 50-50 for June, ~71% for July, and three cuts (75 bps) by year-end. The tension between the Fed's cautious inflation-fighting posture and the bond market's growth-scare pricing is the defining dynamic heading into the March SEP meeting with its updated dot plot.

For our thesis watchlist, the rally in Treasuries is a tailwind for the rate-sensitive names in our energy storage (FLNC, EOSE), space (RKLB, LUNR), and nuclear (CEG, VST) verticals -- lower long-term rates improve project economics for capital-intensive infrastructure. It is also constructive for defense primes (LMT, RTX, NOC), which benefit from a lower discount rate on their multi-year backlog streams. Credit spreads at near-historic tights remain a background risk if the growth scare deepens into something more fundamental.

## Treasury Yields

| Maturity | Close Feb 27 | Close Feb 20 | Weekly Change (bps) | Monthly Change (Feb) | Note |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|------|
| 2-Year   | 3.38%       | 3.74%       | -36 bps             | ~-25 bps            | Lowest since August 2022; massive bull flattening |
| 5-Year   | 3.57%       | 3.69%       | -12 bps             | ~-20 bps            | Belly of the curve followed long end lower |

**Intra-week dynamics:** Monday (Feb 23) saw the 10-year hovering near 4.09% as new Trump tariff threats on Canada and Mexico weighed on sentiment and Waller's "coin flip" speech introduced ambiguity on March. Tuesday (Feb 24) brought a renewed bid for Treasuries amid deteriorating consumer confidence and equity weakness, with the 10-year testing 4.05%. Wednesday (Feb 25) saw further buying as Musalem's "balanced risk" comments did nothing to halt the safety trade. Thursday (Feb 26) the 10-year traded right around 4.00% as risk-off sentiment intensified. Friday (Feb 27) was the inflection -- the 10-year decisively broke below 4% to settle at 3.97% on a combination of hot PPI data (paradoxically fueling stagflation fears rather than hawkish repricing), a sharp equity selloff (Dow -500+), and AI disruption concerns. The 2-year's 36 bp weekly plunge was the standout -- a dramatic bull-flattening move driven by growing conviction that labor market weakness will force the Fed's hand.

**Monthly context:** February saw the 10-year fall ~25 bps from its January peak of 4.26%, while the 2-year dropped even more aggressively. The Bloomberg Treasury Index gained +1.5% for the month -- the best monthly return in a year -- with long-duration Treasuries gaining approximately 4%. About $16.3 billion flowed into Treasury funds during the first two months of 2026, per EPFR.

## Yield Curve

| Spread        | Feb 27 Level | Feb 20 Level | Weekly Change | Status |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 2s10s Spread  | +59 bps     | +34 bps     | +25 bps       | Sharp bull-steepening; widest since early 2022 |
| 3m10y Spread  | +31 bps     | ~+40 bps    | -9 bps        | Still positive but narrowing |

*Sources: [FRED 2s10s Spread (T10Y2Y)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y) [5], [FRED 3m10y Spread (T10Y3M)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M) [6], [Seeking Alpha: 2s10s Widest Since January 2022](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547859-us-yield-curve-steepens-as-2s10s-spread-hits-widest-since-january-2022) [7]*

The yield curve underwent a dramatic **bull steepening** this week. The 2-year plunged 36 bps as markets priced in a more aggressive easing trajectory, while the 10-year fell a more modest 11 bps. The result was a 2s10s spread explosion from +34 bps to approximately +59 bps -- the widest since January 2022 and a stark departure from the 2022-2024 deep inversion regime.

The 3m10y spread narrowed slightly to approximately +31 bps from +40 bps as T-bill rates remained anchored near 3.7% (close to the fed funds midpoint of 3.625%) while the 10-year fell below 4%. Notably, the 3m10y has been swinging between positive and negative territory in late February, reflecting the tug-of-war between the Fed's hold stance and the market's growth scare.

**Interpretation:** The bull steepening is a classic growth-scare signal -- the front end is moving aggressively to price in future rate cuts while the long end declines more slowly due to residual inflation concerns and term premium. This is the mirror image of the prior week's modest bear steepening. The speed of the 2s10s widening -- 25 bps in a single week -- underscores how quickly market expectations can shift. The February article from FinancialContent describing the "2026 Yield Curve Twist" captures the dynamic well: short-term rates elevated by hawkish Fed rhetoric while long-term rates sink on safe-haven demand and growth concerns.

## Fed Watch

### Current Rate: 3.50%-3.75% (held January 28, 2026; 10-2 vote, Waller dissented for a cut)

No FOMC meeting occurred during this reporting week. The next meeting is **March 17-18** -- a critical SEP meeting with updated dot plot, economic projections, and a press conference. This will be the first 2026 dot plot and will provide essential guidance on the committee's rate path expectations.

### FOMC Minutes Recap (Released Feb 18 -- Prior Week, Still Reverberating)

The January 27-28 meeting minutes, released the prior week, continued to shape market dynamics. Key themes that reverberated this week:

- **Rate-hike option remains on the table.** Several officials wanted post-meeting language to reflect "a two-sided description of future interest rate decisions." Fortune headlined the minutes as "a headache already brewing for Kevin Warsh."
- **Inflation is the binding constraint.** Most participants judged the risk of inflation running persistently above 2% as "meaningful," and cautioned progress may be "slower and more uneven than generally expected."
- **Tariff impact viewed as transitory but uncertain.** Officials expected tariff-driven price increases to wane as the year progresses, but acknowledged significant uncertainty around timing and magnitude.
- **Economic expansion acknowledged as solid.** Members agreed indicators suggested the economy was expanding at a "solid pace."

### Kevin Warsh Nomination -- Key Backdrop

The nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair (announced January 30) remained a significant backdrop to this week's rate action. Warsh, who faces confirmation hearings in March, is widely viewed as more hawkish than Chair Powell and potentially favoring a more aggressive balance sheet normalization. The "Warsh Shock" narrative -- which FinancialContent described as signaling "a radical shift to sound money" -- is contributing to uncertainty around the Fed leadership transition (Powell's term expires May 2026). Markets are parsing every data point through the lens of how a Warsh-led Fed might react differently.

### Fed Speakers This Week

| Speaker | Date | Lean | Key Points |
|---------|------|------|------------|
| **Gov. Christopher Waller** | Feb 23 | Dovish-leaning | March cut is "a coin flip" depending on Feb jobs data; 2025 payroll revisions suggest employment may have actually *fallen* -- weakest year outside recession since 1945; Q4 2025 GDP at 1.4% but smoothing for shutdown effects implies ~2%+ growth; dissented in January for a 25 bp cut [14][15] |
| **Austan Goolsbee** (Chicago) | Feb 24 | Hawkish-hold | "Front-loading too many rate cuts is not prudent"; 3% inflation "is not good enough -- and it's not what we promised"; Supreme Court tariff ruling adds uncertainty; multiple cuts possible if inflation cooperates [16][17] |
| **Raphael Bostic** (Atlanta) | Feb 25 | Hawkish-hold | Economy "remarkably resilient"; inflation at ~3% is "a long way from the 2% target"; "no rush" to cut rates; prioritizes price stability over employment risks [18] |
| **Tom Barkin** (Richmond) | Feb 24 | Neutral-hold | Monetary policy is "well positioned" and "appropriately aligned to address potential risks"; does not expect AI to cause "abrupt shifts" in the economy; labor market less tight but not alarming [19] |
| **Albert Musalem** (St. Louis) | Feb 25-26 | Neutral-hold | Policy rate "near neutral" and "appropriately balancing risks"; expects economy to grow "at or above potential" (~2%); half of excess inflation comes from tariffs and should fade; manufacturing "surprisingly doing well" [20][21] |
| **Susan Collins** (Boston) | Feb 25 | Hawkish-hold | "Patient and deliberate approach is appropriate"; after 175 bps of easing, policy is "mildly restrictive, perhaps quite close to neutral already"; "quite likely" to hold rates steady "for some time" [22] |

**Assessment:** The dominant tone was hawkish-hold, with Goolsbee, Bostic, and Collins all emphasizing patience and the inadequacy of current inflation levels. Waller was the notable outlier -- his "coin flip" framing on March and his alarming labor market revision data suggest he remains the committee's leading dove and could dissent again in March. The contrast between Waller's labor market concerns (2025 payrolls may show a net decline) and Bostic's characterization of a "remarkably resilient" economy illustrates the deep divisions within the committee heading into the March SEP.

### Rate Expectations -- CME FedWatch

As of Feb 27 close:

| Meeting | Hold | 25 bps Cut | 50+ bps Cut | Shift vs. Prior Week |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| March 18, 2026 | ~94% | ~6% | <1% | Essentially unchanged; hold is near-certainty |
| April 29, 2026 | ~55% | ~45% | <1% | Cut odds have risen meaningfully to near coin-flip |
| June 17, 2026 | ~50% | ~45% | ~5% | ~50-50 for a cut; June remains earliest plausible date |
| July 29, 2026 | ~29% | ~71% | N/A | ~71% probability of at least one cut by July |
| Dec 9, 2026 | ~15% | ~30% | ~55% | Three cuts (75 bps) by year-end is the market base case |

**Full-year 2026 expectations:** The market has re-broadened its easing expectations after the prior week's hawkish repricing. While the March hold is locked in, the bond market's aggressive rally this week signals growing conviction that the labor market is weakening faster than the Fed acknowledges. The three-cut base case by year-end (down to 2.75-3.00%) has re-emerged as the market consensus, up from the two-cut consensus established after the minutes release. The key variable is the February employment report (due the first Friday of March), which Waller explicitly flagged as the decision point for March.

### March 18 FOMC Preview

The March 17-18 meeting will be the most consequential of 2026 so far:

- **First 2026 dot plot:** Will reveal whether the median FOMC projection has shifted from the December 2025 SEP (which implied 2-3 cuts in 2026).
- **Inflation projections vs. labor data:** If February jobs disappoint as Waller's revised data suggests, the committee may be forced to confront a genuine dual-mandate tension -- elevated inflation with a softening labor market.
- **Warsh confirmation watch:** Any developments in Warsh's Senate confirmation hearings could influence the committee's forward guidance framing.

## Credit Markets

| Metric | Feb 27 Level | Feb 20 Level | Weekly Change | Note |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|------|
| IG OAS (ICE BofA) | ~77 bps | ~77 bps | Flat | 2nd percentile over 20-year lookback; near historic tights |
| HY OAS (ICE BofA) | ~294 bps | ~286 bps | +8 bps | Modest widening on risk-off; still well below historical average |
| BB OAS | ~210 bps (est.) | ~205 bps (est.) | +5 bps (est.) | Higher-quality HY held better |
| CCC & Lower OAS | ~700+ bps (est.) | ~680 bps (est.) | +20 bps (est.) | Weakest credits showing most stress |

*Sources: [FRED: ICE BofA IG OAS (BAMLC0A0CM)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLC0A0CM) [25], [FRED: ICE BofA HY OAS (BAMLH0A0HYM2)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2) [26], [Trading Economics: HY OAS](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/bofa-merrill-lynch-us-high-yield-option-adjusted-spread-fed-data.html) [27]*

**Investment grade** spreads held firm at ~77 bps despite the risk-off tone, demonstrating the resilience of IG credit in a flight-to-quality environment. IG bonds benefit from the same safety bid as Treasuries, and strong corporate fundamentals continue to support tight spreads. The 77 bp level sits in the 2nd percentile over a 20-year lookback, meaning spreads have been tighter only ~2% of the time in the past two decades. Charles Schwab's 2026 outlook maintains an "up-in-quality" recommendation given these historically tight levels.

**High yield** spreads widened modestly to ~294 bps from ~286 bps as the equity selloff and risk-off positioning spilled into lower-quality credit. The 8 bp widening is notable but not alarming -- HY OAS remains well below the historical average of ~450-500 bps and far from the 600+ bps stress levels seen during true credit events. CCC-rated bonds showed the most stress, consistent with the pattern during risk-off weeks where the weakest credits bear disproportionate pressure.

**Issuance:** Corporate bond issuance slowed into February relative to January's pace. YTD 2026 IG issuance through January was $239.4B (+2.5% YoY). HY issuance YTD hit $50B (+28% YoY), reflecting strong demand for yield in a rate-cutting environment. Full-year 2026 gross IG supply is expected to reach a record near $2 trillion, driven in part by AI-related infrastructure financing and increased M&A activity. Marketplace reported on the "trillion-dollar bond sell-off funding data centers," highlighting how hyperscaler capex is creating significant new corporate bond supply.

**Stress signals:** No material stress signals in credit markets. Default rates remain low, and the January 2026 Senior Loan Officer Survey showed banks expecting lending standards to remain basically unchanged across most loan categories in 2026, with demand expected to strengthen for C&I loans and commercial real estate. Banks did flag potential quality deterioration in C&I loans to small firms and consumer loan categories -- worth monitoring as a leading indicator.

## Liquidity

| Metric | Latest Level | Prior Week | Change | Note |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------|------|
| TGA Balance | ~$849B | ~$949B | -$100B | Drawdown from February high; seasonal tax dynamics |
| ON RRP Facility Usage | Near zero | Near zero | Flat | Effectively drained; no longer a meaningful liquidity buffer |
| Fed Total Assets | ~$6.6T | ~$6.6T | Flat | QT ended Dec 1, 2025; balance sheet stable |
| Bank Reserves | ~$3.2-3.3T (est.) | ~$3.2-3.3T (est.) | Flat | At "ample" level per FOMC assessment |

### QT Status -- Concluded

The Federal Reserve officially ceased balance sheet runoff (QT2) on December 1, 2025, having reduced total securities holdings by over $2.2 trillion since June 2022 (~$1.6T in Treasuries, ~$600B in agency MBS). The Fed's total assets have stabilized at approximately $6.6 trillion as of mid-February 2026. Going forward, the Fed intends to buy and sell Treasuries to match trend growth in demand for bank reserves, effectively maintaining the balance sheet at current levels.

The Cleveland Fed's February 2026 Economic Commentary noted that "given this sizable reduction in the balance sheet and money market conditions suggesting that reserve levels were approaching the ample level, the Committee judged it appropriate to conclude balance sheet runoff." This is significant context for the Warsh nomination -- Warsh is widely expected to favor more aggressive balance sheet normalization if confirmed, potentially reopening the QT question in H2 2026.

### ON RRP Facility

The ON RRP facility has been effectively drained to near-zero usage, down from its peak of over $2.5 trillion in late 2022. This reflects the normalization of money market conditions as the excess liquidity injected during the pandemic has been absorbed. The facility's near-zero usage means it is no longer acting as a meaningful buffer for excess liquidity in the financial system. Year-end 2025 saw a brief spike in the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) to $75 billion, but this dissolved by early January.

### TGA Dynamics

The Treasury General Account balance declined to approximately $849 billion from ~$949B the prior week, a drawdown of roughly $100 billion. This is consistent with seasonal spending patterns and the resumption of normal Treasury operations. The TGA drawdown injects reserves into the banking system, which is modestly supportive of liquidity conditions. Watch for TGA rebuilding around April's tax season, which could temporarily tighten reserves.

### Funding Market Conditions

No significant stress signals in overnight funding markets. The SOFR rate remains well-behaved near the fed funds midpoint. The year-end liquidity turmoil (SRF spike to $75B) resolved quickly, and no similar pressures have emerged in early 2026. The January 2026 SLOOS survey confirmed banks expect demand to strengthen across most loan categories, with standards remaining broadly unchanged -- consistent with adequate liquidity conditions.
