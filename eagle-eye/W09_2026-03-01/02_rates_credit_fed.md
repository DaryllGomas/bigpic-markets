# Rates, Credit & Fed

*Week ending February 27, 2026 | Eagle Eye W09*

## Treasury Yields

Treasuries staged their best monthly rally in a year during February, with safe-haven demand accelerating into month-end as investors fled a stock market selloff, AI disruption fears, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and mounting private credit concerns. The 10-year yield broke below 4% for the first time in four months.

| Maturity | Feb 27 Close | Feb 20 Close | Weekly Change | Month-End Context |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **2-Year** | 3.38% | 3.48% | **-10 bps** | Lowest since August 2022 |
| **5-Year** | ~3.60% (est.) | ~3.72% (est.) | **~-12 bps** | Tracking broader rally |
| **10-Year** | 3.97% | 4.08% | **-11 bps** | Broke below 4% intraday; lowest in 4 months |
| **30-Year** | 4.63% | 4.72% | **-9 bps** | Lagging the rally, curve steepening at long end |

**February recap:** The 10-year yield fell approximately 25 bps across the month (from ~4.22% at end of January), its strongest monthly performance in a year. The front end moved even more aggressively, with the 2-year dropping from ~3.60% at end of January. The rally gathered steam on (1) cooling CPI (2.4% YoY in January, down from 2.7% in December), (2) safe-haven flows amid equity selloff, and (3) growing recession anxieties despite resilient headline data.

**The "yield curve twist":** A notable structural development in late February was T-bills (1-month to 12-month) climbing toward 3.7% while longer-dated yields fell. This inversion at the very front end reflects the market pricing Fed on hold through mid-year while long-end rallies on growth fears -- a classic late-cycle pattern.

---

## Yield Curve

### 2s10s Spread

The 2s10s spread ended the week at approximately **+59 bps** (3.97% minus 3.38%), having narrowed from roughly +60 bps the prior week. After reaching +74 bps earlier in 2026, the curve has been bull-flattening as longer-dated yields fell faster than the front end on safe-haven demand. The spread has swung back and forth near the boundary of positive and narrowing territory in recent sessions.

**Context:** The curve un-inverted in late 2024 and has been positively sloped since mid-December 2024. The current +59 bps spread is well within normal range, but the recent flattening trend bears watching -- it suggests the market is rotating from "reflation" toward "growth scare."

### 3-Month / 10-Year Spread

The 3m10y spread has been oscillating around zero since late February, with the spread swinging back and forth from positive to negative territory since February 26. With 3-month T-bills near 3.70% and the 10-year at 3.97%, the spread sits at roughly **+27 bps** -- but dangerously close to inversion territory.

**Recession signal:** The 3m10y spread was inverted from October 2022 through December 2024. The NY Fed's recession probability model, which uses this spread as its primary input, still shows elevated recession probability given the prolonged prior inversion. Historical lead time from inversion to recession ranges from 34-69 weeks (average ~48 weeks). If this spread re-inverts, it would reignite recession watch in earnest.

### Fed Funds Futures Pricing

| Meeting | Date | Hold Probability | Cut Probability |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **March** | Mar 18 | ~77% | ~23% (25 bps cut) |
| **May** | Apr 29 | ~65% | ~35% cumulative |
| **June** | Jun 17 | ~45% | ~55% (at least one cut) |
| **Year-end** | Dec 9 | -- | 2-3 cuts (50-75 bps) priced |

The March cut probability collapsed from nearly 50% a month ago to just ~6% immediately after the hawkish FOMC minutes release (Feb 18), then recovered to ~23% by week-end as the bond rally and equity selloff shifted the calculus. Markets are pricing June as the earliest likely cut date, with 2-3 total cuts (50-75 bps) by year-end. The distribution is wide: 16.6% see just one cut, 30.6% see two, and 29.1% see three.

## Fed Watch

### FOMC Minutes (Jan 27-28 meeting, released Feb 18)

The January minutes were the most hawkish development of the week -- arguably of 2026 so far. Key revelations:

- **Rate hike on the table:** Several officials "entertained the notion that rate hikes could be on the table" and wanted the statement to reflect "a two-sided description of the Committee's future interest rate decisions." This was a shock to markets still pricing in cuts.

- **Inflation caution dominant:** "Most participants cautioned that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective might be slower and more uneven than generally expected and judged that the risk of inflation running persistently above the Committee's objective was meaningful."

- **Deep division:** The Committee is split between hawks worried about entrenched inflation and doves focused on labor market softening. Two members dissented at the January meeting (voting to cut rather than hold), creating a 10-2 split.

- **"Hawkish pause" framing:** After three consecutive cuts in late 2025 (totaling 75 bps), the hold at 3.50-3.75% was widely characterized as a hawkish pause, not a neutral one.

### Kevin Warsh Nomination (Formally transmitted Feb 24)

The biggest structural story in rates this week was the formal Senate transmission of Kevin Warsh's nomination to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair (Powell's term expires May 15, 2026). This is a generational shift:

- **"Sound money" doctrine:** Warsh is a known inflation hawk from his time as the youngest-ever Fed Governor (2006-2011) and vocal critic of QE from the Hoover Institution. His nomination signals a "definitive end to the Powell Era."

- **Balance sheet pivot:** Markets are pricing in aggressive quantitative tightening alongside potential front-loaded rate cuts -- a "tapering plus rate cuts" strategy that would rebuild Fed credibility through active balance sheet reduction.

- **Bear steepening:** The initial market reaction was a dramatic bear steepening of the yield curve as investors repriced the long end for a more hawkish long-term regime while expecting near-term cuts to continue.

- **Confirmation uncertainty:** The Senate process is expected to be contentious. Warsh must thread the needle between Trump's desire for lower rates and his own hawkish instincts.

### Fed Speaker Highlights (Week of Feb 24-28)

| Speaker | Role | Lean | Key Quote |
|---------|------|------|-----------|
| **Christopher Waller** | Governor | Dovish | Voted to cut in January (minority). Said solid January jobs could mean "skip a rate cut at the next meeting" but maintained that 2025 jobs data was "very weak." |
| **Raphael Bostic** | Atlanta Fed President | Hawkish | "No rate cuts penciled in for 2026." Neutral is "one or two cuts away" but economy's current strength raises inflation persistence risk. |
| **Susan Collins** | Boston Fed President | Neutral-Hawkish | "A patient and deliberate approach is appropriate at this stage... we're at a mildly restrictive, perhaps quite close to neutral policy already." |
| **Alberto Musalem** | St. Louis Fed President | Neutral-Hawkish | Sees "a good year" for the economy, growth "at or above potential." Warned it would be "unadvisable to lower the rate into accommodative territory" unless labor market weakens. |

**Net lean:** The Fedspeak this week was decidedly hawkish. Three of four speakers either pushed back on near-term cuts or explicitly flagged inflation risks. Only Waller maintained a dovish posture, and even he acknowledged the case for holding in March. The gap between market pricing (2-3 cuts by year-end) and Fed rhetoric (0-1 cuts) remains wide.

## Credit Markets

### Investment Grade

IG spreads reached a three-decade low of approximately **71 bps** OAS in January 2026 -- the tightest since 1998. During the week ending Feb 27, spreads widened modestly but remain historically compressed:

- **Current IG OAS:** ~78-82 bps (up ~7-11 bps from the January trough)
- **Context:** IG yields remain attractive in absolute terms, near the upper end of their 15-year range, even as spreads are at the lower end

### High Yield

HY spreads tightened to 2007-era levels earlier in 2026 but showed signs of stress in the final week of February:

- **Current HY OAS:** ~290-310 bps (estimated, having widened from ~270 bps trough)
- **Quality bifurcation:** BB-rated bonds continue to tighten while CCC and lower-rated credits have widened -- a classic risk-off divergence pattern
- Global credit spreads widened the most in four months during the week, per Bloomberg

### Private Credit: The Emerging Fault Line

The most concerning credit story of the week was escalating private credit fears:

- **Market size:** ~$2 trillion globally, having grown fivefold since 2008
- **DOJ warning:** The Department of Justice publicly warned about "creative" marks and divergent valuation practices in private portfolios
- **SEC inquiry:** A high-profile SEC inquiry into Egan-Jones Ratings placed private credit ratings integrity under scrutiny
- **Jamie Dimon's warning:** Financial firms are "doing dumb things" in risky lending; Mohamed El-Erian drew parallels with the 2008 run-up
- **AI-driven defaults:** AI disruption is pressuring software firms that comprise a significant portion of private credit portfolios, with defaults rising
- **Bloomberg assessment:** The market is split between those seeing an "imminent crisis" and those dismissing concerns as overblown -- a pattern that typically precedes actual stress

This matters for public markets because hidden losses in private credit could cascade into forced selling of liquid assets, tighter lending standards, and broader risk aversion.

### Bank Lending Conditions

The January 2026 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) showed:

- **C&I loans:** Modest net tightening for firms of all sizes in Q4 2025
- **CRE:** Slight easing for multifamily; unchanged for construction and commercial
- **2026 outlook:** Most banks expect standards to "remain basically unchanged" -- with exceptions for tightening on construction/land development and easing on auto loans
- **Tightening rationale:** Less favorable economic outlook, expected deterioration in collateral values, reduced risk tolerance
- **Net read:** Lending conditions are not yet restrictive, but the tightening bias on commercial loans bears watching in the context of the broader growth scare narrative

---

## Liquidity

### Treasury General Account (TGA)

- **Current balance:** ~$849.4 billion (as of Feb 26)
- **Context:** A high TGA balance drains reserves from the banking system. At ~$850B, the TGA is elevated, which acts as a mild liquidity headwind. However, tax season (April) typically causes a temporary surge followed by a drawdown, which would be liquidity-positive for markets in Q2.

### Overnight Reverse Repo (ON RRP)

- **Current status:** The ON RRP facility has been draining steadily throughout 2024-2025 as money market funds shifted into T-bills. Usage has fallen dramatically from its peak of ~$2.5 trillion (2022) toward minimal levels
- **Significance:** The near-depletion of ON RRP means the next phase of QT will drain bank reserves directly rather than excess cash parked at the Fed. This is when liquidity tightening becomes more binding -- a key risk factor the Fed is monitoring as it debates the pace of balance sheet reduction

### Net Liquidity Assessment

The liquidity picture is mixed:
- **Positive:** Bond rally providing capital gains to fixed-income portfolios; credit conditions not yet restrictive; T-bill issuance providing absorption capacity
- **Negative:** Elevated TGA draining reserves; ON RRP near depletion means QT bites harder; private credit opacity creating hidden liquidity risk; Warsh nomination signals more aggressive future balance sheet reduction

## Weekend Developments

### Warsh Nomination Aftermath (Feb 27-Mar 1)

The Warsh nomination, formally transmitted on February 24, continued to dominate weekend commentary. Market participants are processing the implications of a "sound money" Fed chair who has advocated for aggressive balance sheet reduction. The Senate confirmation timeline is uncertain but the market is already pricing a regime change -- the immediate effect has been a steeper yield curve as the long end prices in a more hawkish structural posture.

### Middle East Tensions

Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East escalated through the week and into the weekend, contributing to safe-haven Treasury demand. This was cited as a key driver of Friday's bond rally alongside AI disruption fears and private credit concerns. No single catalytic event, but the accumulation of risk factors is keeping the bid under Treasuries.

### March FOMC Preview (Mar 17-18)

The upcoming March 17-18 FOMC meeting is the first of 2026 to include the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and dot plot. This is the most consequential near-term event for rates:

- **Dot plot:** Will the median dot shift hawkish from the December 2025 projection of 2-3 cuts in 2026? Given the minutes' hawkish tone and speaker commentary, a reduction to 1-2 cuts would be the base case
- **Growth projections:** Any downgrade to GDP growth would validate the recession-scare narrative and support the bond rally
- **Inflation projections:** Core PCE forecasts above 2.5% for year-end 2026 would reinforce the "higher for longer" message
- **Market structure:** This FOMC falls within Triple Witch week (Mar 20), creating a powerful convergence of positioning flows and policy risk

### Key Data in the Week Ahead

- **ISM Manufacturing (Mon Mar 2):** Leading indicator for industrial activity
- **ISM Services (Wed Mar 4):** The dominant sector of the economy
- **Nonfarm Payrolls (Fri Mar 6):** The most market-moving data point; a weak print could accelerate the bond rally and reprice June cut odds higher

## Sector Thesis Implications

**For AI Infrastructure:** The bond rally and falling yields are directionally supportive of growth/duration assets (NVDA, AVGO, PLTR). However, the AI disruption narrative that contributed to the equity selloff could create a paradox -- falling rates support valuations but AI skepticism pressures earnings multiples. The "4% monetization problem" identified in the AI thesis remains the key tension.

**For Nuclear/Energy:** Lower rates ease financing costs for capital-intensive nuclear builds (CEG, VST). The 20-year PPA model for hyperscaler nuclear deals becomes more attractive as the discount rate falls. Uranium miners (CCJ, UEC) benefit from the broader risk-off rotation into real assets.

**For Defense:** Defense spending (LMT, RTX, NOC) is non-discretionary and budget-driven, making it relatively insensitive to rate movements. However, the growth scare narrative could redirect investor flows toward defensive sectors -- a tailwind for the defense primes.

**For Critical Minerals:** Lower rates support capital-intensive mining projects (FCX, ALB, MP). The copper structural deficit thesis strengthens if lower rates stimulate infrastructure spending while mining supply remains constrained.
