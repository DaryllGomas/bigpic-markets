# Commodities & Forex — Week Ending 2026-02-27

---

## Energy

### Crude Oil

**WTI** closed the week at **$67.02/bbl**, up **+3.21% WoW**, its highest weekly settlement since August. **Brent** settled in the **$70.70-$72.87/bbl** range on Friday, up approximately **+2.9%** on the session, with a geopolitical risk premium of **$8-10/bbl** embedded in prices.

The dominant catalyst this week was the **US-Iran nuclear talks** in Rome, which concluded Thursday without a deal. The US demanded Iran destroy its three main nuclear sites (Fordow, Natanz, Isfahan) and surrender all enriched uranium, while Iran sought sanctions relief. Technical-level discussions were extended into next week in Vienna. Oil rose 2%+ on Friday as traders priced in continued supply disruption risk through the **Strait of Hormuz**, through which approximately 20% of global oil supply transits. The diplomatic breakdown in mid-February had already injected a "war premium" into crude, and this week's inconclusive talks sustained it.

**OPEC+ maintained its production pause** through Q1 2026, with the eight key producers (Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, Oman) reaffirming the November 2025 decision to hold output flat. The group reiterated its commitment to full conformity with voluntary cuts and compensation for overproduction since January 2024. The production discipline is providing a floor under prices even as demand growth concerns linger.

**EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report** (week ending Feb 20, released Feb 25): US commercial crude inventories **surged by 16.0 million barrels** to 435.8 million barrels — the largest weekly build in three years and well above the 1.8 million barrel consensus estimate. Despite the build, inventories remain **3% below the five-year average**. Cushing hub stocks rose 881K barrels. Gasoline inventories drew 3.2M barrels and distillates drew 4.6M barrels. Refinery utilization dropped to **88.6%** (from 91.0% the prior week), with inputs averaging 15.7M bbl/day.

**EIA February STEO** forecast the 2026 average Henry Hub price **23% higher** than previously projected, driven by winter cold and increased LNG export capacity. J.P. Morgan maintains a bearish medium-term outlook for Brent.

### Natural Gas

**Henry Hub** traded near **$3.13-3.24/MMBtu** on February 27, stabilizing after extreme volatility earlier in the month. On February 2, the March prompt-month contract posted its **largest single-day decline in 30 years (-25.7%)** to $3.24/MMBtu as mild weather forecasts crushed the January cold premium (Winter Storm Fern had pushed prices briefly to ~$62/MMBtu at Dawn hub).

**EIA storage** (week ending Feb 6): Working gas at **2,214 Bcf**, a weekly draw of **249 Bcf**. Stocks were **97 Bcf below** year-ago levels and **130 Bcf below** the five-year average of 2,344 Bcf. However, analysts projected the 97 Bcf year-over-year deficit could quickly flip to a **170 Bcf surplus** within three weeks if mild weather materializes. Physical gas prices firmed on Friday for weekend delivery as cold air from Western Canada threatened the Midwest and East.

**Thesis link:** Natural gas as a bridge fuel for AI data center power demand remains a core thesis (AI Infrastructure: Williams Companies, Kinder Morgan). Henry Hub volatility underscores the importance of contracted PPAs vs. merchant exposure for data center operators.

## Metals

### Gold

**Gold** closed Friday at approximately **$5,230-5,247/oz**, up roughly **$54/oz on the day (+1.0%)**. For the week, gold rose approximately **+2.5-3.0%** from its prior-week close near $5,107/oz. The metal hit a session high of **$5,250** on Friday and a three-week high of **$5,248.89** earlier in the week. Gold had set an all-time record of **$5,594.82/oz on January 29** before pulling back on profit-taking.

Year-to-date, spot gold is up approximately **+20%**, driven by: (1) persistent central bank buying — EM central banks purchased several thousand tonnes cumulatively, creating persistent structural demand; (2) US-Iran geopolitical risk premium supporting safe-haven flows; (3) expectations for **3 Fed rate cuts (75 bps)** priced by year-end with Fed Funds at 3.50-3.75%; (4) tariff uncertainty from the Trump administration's shifting trade policies; (5) DXY weakness — the dollar index near multi-year lows at ~97.7 reduces the opportunity cost of holding gold.

**Thesis link:** Gold's surge benefits thesis-relevant miners and positions it as a macro hedge across all portfolios. The extraordinary move from ~$2,860/oz a year ago to $5,247/oz represents a **+83% YoY gain**.

### Silver

**Silver** traded at approximately **$89.64-92.06/oz** on February 27, with intraday volatility reflecting a significant recovery from earlier in the month. One data source recorded a **+5.77%** daily move to $92.02/oz. Silver had experienced a dramatic **-26% crash on January 30** before recovering through February.

Year-over-year, silver is up approximately **+$60/oz (+185%+)**, massively outperforming gold on a percentage basis. The gold-silver ratio has compressed significantly. Silver's dual nature as a monetary metal and an industrial commodity (solar panels, electronics, EV components) is driving its outperformance, with industrial demand from the energy transition providing a structural floor.

### Copper

**Copper** traded at approximately **$5.90-5.97/lb** on COMEX (**~$13,250/MT on LME**) on February 27, roughly flat on the day but up approximately **+1.8% for the month** and **+31% YoY**. Weekly scrap copper prices rose **+3.1-3.2%** during the Feb 20-26 period.

The market is balanced between structural supply deficit concerns and near-term demand softness from China's Lunar New Year slowdown. **J.P. Morgan projects a 330,000-tonne refined copper shortfall in 2026** — the largest gap in years — driven by AI data center buildout (copper demand projected to grow from 1.1M MT in 2025 to 2.5M MT by 2040), EV adoption, and grid modernization. US tariff policy is adding complexity: a **50% tariff on semi-finished copper** has altered trade flows, with a refined-copper review deadline of **June 30, 2026** sustaining pre-positioning. After the Supreme Court ruled against emergency tariff powers, the administration rolled out a 10% global levy subsequently raised to 15%.

**Thesis link:** Copper is a Tier 1 thesis commodity across critical minerals (FCX, SCCO), AI infrastructure (data center power), and energy storage (EVs, grid). Freeport-McMoRan's Grasberg restart in Q2 2026 is the most important near-term catalyst. Southern Copper's Tia Maria commissioning on track.

### Uranium

**Uranium spot** was at approximately **$89.50/lb U3O8** as of February 20 (TradeTech), up **+6.2% over the past month** and **+30.7% YoY**. Uranium touched $100/lb in January 2026 before pulling back slightly.

The structural supply deficit of **30-40M lbs/year** persists, with primary mine supply covering only ~75% of reactor demand (~179M lbs). Catalysts this month included: continued Kazatomprom production discipline (~10% below capacity), the US government announcing **$2.7B in contracts to Centrus and other enrichers** to break Russian enrichment dependence (46% of global capacity), and Cameco's rising contract prices (+5-10% expected in 2026). NexGen Energy's CNSC hearing (Feb 9-13) for the Rook I project — the largest development-stage uranium mine — was a key sector event.

**Thesis link:** Uranium is a Tier 1 thesis commodity for the nuclear renaissance. Hyperscaler nuclear PPAs totaling $50B+ (Microsoft-Constellation TMI, Meta-Vistra, Amazon-Talen) are driving long-term demand. Fleet operators CEG, VST, TLN are the primary beneficiaries. Fuel cycle names CCJ, LEU, NXE, UEC, and UUUU (dual uranium/REE) offer structural exposure to the supply deficit.

## Commodities

### Lithium

**Lithium carbonate** rallied sharply late in the week to **177,000 CNY/tonne (~$25,856/tonne)** on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange, up **+5.4% on February 26** alone. Intraday swings exceeded **+9%**. Despite a -9.2% pullback over the preceding month, lithium remains up approximately **+80% YoY**.

The catalyst was **Zimbabwe's sudden ban on lithium concentrate exports** on February 25 — originally scheduled for January 2027 but pulled forward to promote domestic processing and curb illegal shipments. Zimbabwe supplied **19% of China's imported lithium concentrate** in 2025 and is the world's second-largest source of hard-rock lithium ore. Analysts warned that if the ban persists, China's lithium carbonate supply-demand balance could enter sustained inventory drawdown from May 2026, driving rapid price increases.

Separately, supply-side tightening continued with Chinese authorities canceling **27 mining permits in Jiangxi** (the lithium hub) and CATL's Jianxiawo mine suspension under Beijing's anti-involution campaign. Energy storage demand is providing a powerful demand boost, with Beijing announcing significantly higher BESS spending.

**Thesis link:** Lithium is a Tier 1 thesis commodity for energy storage. Zimbabwe's export ban is a potential inflection point. Watchlist names ALB ($19B, Kings Mountain restart), SQM ($12-14B, lowest-cost producer), PLS.AX (record production), LAC (Thacker Pass construction), and RIO (Arcadium portfolio) are directly impacted. If lithium sustains above $20,000/tonne, producer margin expansion and re-ratings are likely.

### Rare Earths

**NdPr (Neodymium-Praseodymium)** surged to **$123/kg**, the highest since July 2022, with a **+14% weekly gain** and **+40% YTD**. Individual metals: Neodymium at **$214.80/kg (+43.9% YTD)**, Praseodymium at **$207.00/kg (+43.7% YTD)**. Neodymium reached 1,065,000 CNY/T on February 10.

The $123/kg NdPr price is significant because it exceeds the **$110/kg threshold** that triggers US government price support for **MP Materials (MP)** under their landmark DOD supply agreement. China's strategic management of mining quotas and supply constraints continues to tighten availability. The CME is exploring launching the **first-ever rare earth futures contract** targeting NdPr, which would improve price discovery and hedging.

**Thesis link:** Rare earth prices directly impact the critical minerals thesis. MP Materials (Tier 1, $10B, DOD largest shareholder) benefits from both the price surge and the price-floor mechanism. Lynas (LYC.AX/LYSCF) revenue is doubling. USA Rare Earth (USAR, $1.6B CHIPS Act) is ramping initial production. Energy Fuels (UUUU) targets commercial Dy/Tb production by Q4 2026. The November 2026 US-China trade agreement expiry remains the defining catalyst.

### Cobalt

**Cobalt prices have surged +160% YoY** following the DRC's export ban and quota system (96,600 MT/year — roughly half of 2024 volumes). The DRC supplies ~70% of global cobalt, and the quota structure has created a sustained price premium. China's tighter processing controls add further upside pressure.

### Agricultural Commodities

Grain prices finished February on a strong note:

- **Corn**: Crop insurance projected price settled at **$4.62/bu** for the 2026-27 crop, up **+1%+ on the day**
- **Soybeans**: Projected price at **$11.09/bu**, up **$0.55 from last year**, trading +0.5-0.75% higher on Feb 27
- **Winter Wheat**: Led the charge with some contracts jumping **+3%** as traders assessed overly dry conditions across the US Plains and Black Sea geopolitical concerns. May Chicago SRW rose $0.17 to $5.9150; May KC HRW climbed $0.1825 to $5.8050
- **Spring Wheat**: Projected price at **$6.19/bu**

February turned out to be exceptionally kind to grain prices, with drought conditions in the US Plains and Black Sea tensions (Russia-Ukraine) providing fundamental support.

### Other Critical Minerals

**Antimony**: The global market is expected to remain adequately supplied in 2026, with increasing Southeast Asian supply and stable demand. However, China's export controls and US-China trade tensions continue to reshape trade flows. Prices remain elevated after the **+200% surge** in late 2024-2025.

**Gallium**: The Trump administration plans to use a Pentagon AI system called **OPEN (Open Price Exploration for National Security)**, built by DARPA, to calculate fair values for germanium, gallium, antimony, and tungsten. Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocating **$7.5B for critical minerals**, including $2B to expand the national stockpile by 2027.

**Graphite**: New trade walls are forming. China's dominance in battery-grade graphite (~90%+) remains the key supply chain vulnerability for EV battery production.

### US Dollar Index (DXY)

The **DXY** closed the week at approximately **97.65-97.80**, essentially **flat for the week** (+0.04% on Friday). The dollar is on track to finish February **+0.9% higher**, ending a three-month losing streak. Despite the monthly gain, the DXY remains near multi-year lows, having declined substantially from the 108+ levels seen in late 2024.

The dollar traded sideways throughout the week as investors balanced: (1) **stronger-than-expected inflation data** supporting the case for Fed patience; (2) **tariff policy uncertainty** following the Supreme Court ruling against emergency tariff powers; (3) **US-Iran nuclear negotiation risk** adding geopolitical hedging demand; (4) awaiting upcoming PCE inflation data that could shape Fed expectations ahead of the March 17-18 FOMC meeting (first 2026 SEP/dot plot).

**Fed backdrop**: Rates held at 3.50-3.75% after the January meeting (10-2 vote). CME pricing shows **60% probability of hold / 38% probability of cut** at the March meeting. Three cuts (75 bps) are priced by year-end.

### EUR/USD

**EUR/USD** traded in the **1.1770-1.1830** range on Friday, with the pair hovering just below 1.18. The euro was slightly weaker as investors awaited Friday's Eurozone inflation data. The pair remains well above the 1.05-1.08 range of late 2024, reflecting dollar weakness and improved European economic sentiment following Germany's historic defense spending increase (EUR 95B FY2025, +16% YoY; 3.5% GDP target by 2029).

### USD/JPY

**USD/JPY** closed at **156.02**, down **-0.05%** on the day. The yen remains under pressure from the Bank of Japan's gradual normalization path, though BoJ rate hikes have provided some support relative to the 160+ levels seen in mid-2024. Carry trade dynamics remain dominant, with Japan's yield curve slowly steepening.

### GBP/USD

**GBP/USD** closed at **1.3475**, reflecting broad dollar weakness and relatively resilient UK economic data. Sterling has been among the best-performing G10 currencies YTD, supported by the Bank of England's cautious easing path and improving UK growth indicators. The pound is well above the sub-1.25 levels of late 2024.

### Emerging Market Currencies

**EM currencies are proving more stable than G7 peers**, with JPMorgan volatility indexes showing developing-nation currencies have swung less than G7 counterparts for **nearly 200 consecutive days** — the longest streak since 2008 and approaching the record of 208 days (back to 2000).

Key drivers: (1) weaker dollar and expectations for gradual Fed easing reducing EM pressure; (2) strong commodity prices supporting commodity-linked currencies; (3) robust capital inflows — investors poured into EM at the **fastest pace since 2019**, extending 2025's inflows which were the largest since 2009. A Bloomberg index of eight EM currencies is up **+2.8% YTD**, building on a **+17.5% advance in 2025**.

Low-volatility EM currencies attracting flows include the **Singapore dollar, Thai baht, and Chinese yuan**. Commodity-linked EM currencies (BRL, ZAR, CLP) are benefiting from the metals and energy price strength.
