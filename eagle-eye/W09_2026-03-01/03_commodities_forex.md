## CRITICAL: WEEKEND BREAKING NEWS — U.S.-ISRAEL STRIKES ON IRAN

**This is the most significant geopolitical event for commodity markets since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.** On February 28, 2026, the United States and Israel launched joint strikes on Iran ("Operation Epic Fury" / "Operation Roaring Lion"), killing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and multiple senior military and political leaders. Iran has retaliated with missile and drone salvos targeting Israel, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Jordan — all countries hosting U.S. military assets.

**Every commodity and forex price discussed below must be read in two frames:** (1) where prices closed on Friday February 27, and (2) where they are trading now on Sunday evening / early Monday as the crisis unfolds. Friday's close is already stale. Monday's open will be violent.

### Crude Oil — From Quiet Week to Geopolitical Crisis

**Friday Close (Feb 27):**
- **WTI:** ~$66.52/bbl — trading within a well-defined ascending channel, supported by OPEC+ production discipline and a 9.0M barrel EIA inventory draw (week ending Feb 13)
- **Brent:** ~$72.48/bbl — modestly higher on the week after briefly testing $67.40 earlier in February

**Weekend Proxy Prices (Sunday March 1):**
- **WTI:** Jumped above $70.50, topping $72/bbl — up more than 8% from Friday's close
- **Brent:** Surged to $79.41 intraday (briefly touching $82.37 in the first wave of trading) — up ~9-14% from Friday's close
- **Analyst targets:** Citi projects Brent $80-90 in coming days if conflict persists; Barclays warns Brent could hit $100/bbl; UBS flags $120+ scenario if Strait of Hormuz disruption is prolonged

**Weekly Recap (before the strikes):**
The trading week ending February 27 was relatively quiet for oil. Prices were supported by:
- **EIA inventory draw:** Commercial crude stocks fell 9.0M barrels to 419.8M barrels (week ending Feb 13), approximately 5% below the five-year average. Refinery utilization climbed to 91.0% with inputs averaging 16.1M bpd
- **OPEC+ production pause:** The eight-country group (Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, Oman) met virtually on February 1 and reaffirmed the production pause through March 2026, keeping 1.65M bpd of potential supply off the market
- **Tariff overhang:** The Supreme Court struck down IEEPA tariffs on February 20 (6-3 ruling), but Trump immediately imposed a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act, effective February 24. Energy products are exempt from the Section 122 tariffs, but the broader demand uncertainty weighed on sentiment

**OPEC+ Emergency Response (Sunday March 1):**
In an emergency meeting triggered by the Iran crisis, OPEC+ agreed to a 206,000 bpd production increase for April — more than the 137,000 bpd analysts had expected. However, the market is dismissing this as insufficient: "If oil cannot move through Hormuz, an extra 206,000 barrels per day does very little to ease the market." OPEC+ holds approximately 3.5M bpd in spare capacity, concentrated in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

**Strait of Hormuz — De Facto Closure:**
This is the critical variable. Iran's Revolutionary Guard is issuing marine radio warnings instructing ships not to transit the strait. Vessel tracking shows reduced movements, with ships waiting to enter or exit the Persian Gulf or diverting entirely. Missiles struck several oil tankers near the Strait on Sunday, killing one crew member. Approximately 20% of global oil supply — including critical volumes from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, and Iran — transits this chokepoint.

**Thesis Connection:** The nuclear energy thesis gains even more relevance in a world where fossil fuel supply chains face acute disruption risk. Energy security concerns will accelerate data center nuclear PPAs and European energy independence investments. Defense primes with missile and air defense exposure (RTX, LMT) see their order books validated in real-time.

### Natural Gas — From Seasonal Weakness to Supply Shock

**Friday Close (Feb 27):**
- **Henry Hub:** March NYMEX contract closed at $2.969/MMBtu (Feb 25), recovering from a dramatic February selloff
- February saw extreme volatility: the February contract settled at $7.46/MMBtu on January 28, while the March contract posted its largest one-day decline in 30 years on February 2 (down 25.7% to $3.24/MMBtu) as mild weather forecasts crushed winter heating demand
- EIA raised its 2026 Henry Hub average price forecast to $4.30/MMBtu (up 23%) following increased heating demand during earlier severe winter weather

**Weekend Crisis Impact — LNG:**
- **LNG trade through the Strait of Hormuz has effectively halted.** At least 13 empty LNG tankers on the eastern side of the chokepoint have diverted. Japanese shipping giants Nippon Yusen, Mitsui OSK Lines, and Kawasaki Kisen have all ordered vessels to avoid the area
- In 2024, roughly one-fifth of global LNG shipments transited the Strait, predominantly Qatari volumes serving Asian markets
- The Boston Globe reports this threatens the worst disruption in gas markets since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022
- The JKM-TTF spread (Asia-Europe LNG price differential) is expected to widen significantly. US LNG export infrastructure is already operating near capacity, limiting the ability to fill the gap
- European gas prices are expected to gap higher on Monday's open. TTF futures were already elevated on winter demand, and Strait of Hormuz disruption removes a major LNG supply source

**Thesis Connection:** Natural gas is the "bridge fuel" for data center power (AI thesis — 2-3 year deploy time vs. 5-10+ for nuclear). Williams Companies ($5.1B committed to data center power plants) and pipeline operators become even more strategic assets. Domestic US gas production (not exposed to Strait of Hormuz) gains a premium vs. globally traded LNG.

## Metals

### Gold — New All-Time Highs, Safe-Haven Surge

**Friday Close (Feb 27):**
- **Spot gold:** $5,246.70/oz, up $52.50 (+1.01%) on the day
- Gold was already in a structural bull market before the weekend, up 22% year-to-date through Friday, driven by central bank buying, dollar weakness, and tariff uncertainty
- The weekly session was strong across precious metals, with gold posting one of its most compelling sessions of the year on Friday

**Weekend Proxy Prices (March 1):**
- **Gold surged past $5,300/oz** — international spot rose 1.75% to $5,275.82 in initial trading, with reports of prices exceeding $5,300 in Asian and Middle Eastern OTC markets
- Safe-haven buying is intense and broad-based. Wall Street has shifted to a "haven-first" strategy per Bloomberg reporting
- Analysts expect volatility to continue as markets assess the full scope of the Iran conflict

**Drivers:**
1. Geopolitical safe-haven demand (Iran crisis is the accelerant)
2. Central bank gold buying continues at historically elevated levels
3. Dollar weakness (DXY down 7.2% YoY on broad trade-weighted measure)
4. Real interest rate dynamics favorable with 3 Fed cuts priced for 2026
5. Tariff uncertainty (Section 122 10% global tariff in effect, bullion exempt)

### Silver — Explosive Breakout

**Friday Close (Feb 27):**
- **Spot silver:** $92.06/oz, up $4.99 on the day (+5.77%) — outpacing gold by a wide margin
- Silver has gained more than $60/oz over the past year

**Weekend Proxy Prices (March 1):**
- **Silver jumped nearly 8%** in weekend trading. COMEX silver futures climbed 7.67% to $94.30/oz — the sharpest single-day gains since January's record highs
- Silver's dual nature (precious + industrial metal) makes it a unique play: safe-haven buying from the Iran crisis plus industrial demand from solar, EVs, and electrification

**Key Context:** Silver's gold-silver ratio is compressing rapidly. Industrial demand from the energy transition (solar panels, EV wiring, electronics) provides structural support that gold lacks. At these levels, silver is pricing in both monetary premium and industrial scarcity.

### Copper — Supply Deficit Meets Demand Uncertainty

**Friday Close (Feb 27):**
- **Copper:** ~$5.90/lb, holding near this level through February
- The market is balancing persistent supply tightness against signs of weakening demand in China

**Key Dynamics:**
- **Structural deficit:** J.P. Morgan projects a global refined copper deficit of ~330,000 MT in 2026. The ICSG projects a 150,000-tonne shortfall
- **Supply constraints:** Disruptions in Chile, Indonesia, and Peru continue. Freeport-McMoRan's Grasberg phased restart in Q2 2026 remains a critical catalyst
- **Demand drivers:** AI data centers (up to 10x the electrical load of traditional facilities), EV manufacturing, and grid modernization
- **China weakness:** Copper futures fell toward $5.90/lb ahead of the Lunar New Year as Chinese industrial activity slowed
- **Tariff impact:** The Section 122 10% global tariff is in effect, but critical minerals including copper are exempt. However, broader economic drag from tariffs weighs on industrial demand sentiment
- **Price forecasts:** J.P. Morgan projects $12,500/mt average in Q2 2026; Goldman Sachs forecasts $10,710/mt in H1 2026; Bank of America targets $11,000-13,500/mt

**Iran Crisis Implications:** If the Strait of Hormuz disruption persists, it could have secondary effects on copper markets through higher energy costs for smelting and processing, and broader risk-off positioning. However, copper as a critical mineral for energy infrastructure may benefit from accelerated energy security spending.

**Thesis Connection:** The critical minerals thesis (FCX Tier 1, SCCO Tier 2) is reinforced. Copper's structural deficit deepens in 2026. The Freeport Grasberg restart is the near-term catalyst to watch.

### Uranium — Structural Bull Market Intact

**Recent Prices:**
- **Spot uranium:** $88-96/lb range through February 2026, up 17.68% over the past month and 30-32% year-over-year
- End-of-January spot price hit $94.28/lb — the highest level since February 2024 per Cameco
- Uranium futures traded at $96.50/lb on February 2 before pulling back

**Key Dynamics:**
- The 30-40M lb annual supply deficit remains the structural underpinning
- Kazatomprom (world's largest producer) maintaining production discipline at ~10% below capacity
- NexGen Energy (NXE) CNSC hearing completed in February — a key milestone for the largest development-stage uranium mine
- Western enrichment capacity remains constrained; Russian ban effective 2028
- Hyperscaler nuclear PPA pipeline continues to expand (TMI restart, Meta-Vistra, Amazon-Talen)

**Iran Crisis Implications:** The Iran conflict provides an additional tailwind for the nuclear thesis. Energy security concerns are now viscerally apparent — nuclear provides 24/7 baseload power immune to Middle Eastern supply chain disruption. Uranium prices may see additional bid as the market prices in accelerated nuclear buildout. The nuclear fleet operators (CEG, VST, TLN) become even more strategically valuable as energy security assets.

## Commodities

### Agricultural Commodities — Solid February, Geopolitical Risk Rising

**February Performance:**
- **Corn:** May 2026 contracts gained 12 cents (+2.71% monthly), closing near $4.3625
- **Soybeans:** May 2026 futures climbed ~90 cents (+8.44%) — the standout performer
- **Wheat:** May CBOT wheat advanced ~45 cents, with some winter wheat contracts up more than 3%

**Drivers:**
- Technical buying and strong export activity
- Overly dry conditions across the U.S. Plains supporting winter wheat
- Ongoing geopolitical concerns in the Black Sea region
- USDA projects corn plantings falling to 94.0M acres (from 98.8M), while soybean acres rise to 85M (from 81.2M)

**Iran Crisis Implications:** Agricultural commodities face cross-currents. Higher energy costs (diesel, fertilizer input costs) are bearish for farmer margins but supportive of crop prices. Grain exports through the Black Sea region face renewed scrutiny as global conflict escalates. Some agricultural products (beef, tomatoes, oranges) are exempt from the Section 122 tariffs, but broader tariff disruption hurts export relationships with China and other major buyers.

### Supply Chain Indicators

- **Freight rates:** Expected to spike significantly Monday as Strait of Hormuz disruption forces re-routing of global shipping. Insurance costs for vessels transiting the Persian Gulf will surge
- **Container shipping:** Red Sea / Suez Canal disruptions from Houthi attacks had already elevated shipping costs. The Iran conflict adds a second major chokepoint disruption
- **Commodity exemptions from tariffs:** Section 122 tariffs exempt energy products, critical minerals, currency metals/bullion, and certain agricultural products — providing some relief for raw material flows

## Forex

### Dollar Index (DXY) — Structural Weakness, Tactical Safe-Haven Bid

**Friday Close (Feb 27):**
- **DXY:** ~97.45, showing a bearish bias through most of February
- The dollar has been in a sustained downtrend, with the trade-weighted index down 7.2% YoY on the broad measure and 9.3% on major currencies
- Markets are pricing 3 Fed rate cuts in 2026 (June, September, December), eroding the interest rate differential that previously supported the greenback

**Weekend / Iran Crisis Dynamics:**
- DXY rose to approximately 97.85 but failed to break 97.94 resistance before the weekend. After the strikes, the dollar surged on safe-haven flows in early Asian trading
- However, moves in FX have been "quite small" relative to oil and gold, suggesting lingering reluctance to unwind strategic USD shorts
- The dollar benefits from safe-haven status but faces structural headwinds from tariff-induced economic uncertainty, fiscal deficits, and Fed easing expectations
- **Net positioning:** The DXY carries 14-year record bear positioning (speculative shorts), which could trigger a violent short squeeze if the Iran crisis escalates further

### EUR/USD — Germany Fiscal Expansion vs. Geopolitical Risk

**Friday Close (Feb 27):**
- **EUR/USD:** ~1.1818, showing a bullish bias with a 0.28% gain on the day
- The euro has been supported by Germany's landmark EUR 1 trillion fiscal expansion package
- Eurozone annual inflation confirmed at 1.7% in January — below the ECB's 2% target

**Iran Crisis Impact:** The euro faces cross-currents. European energy vulnerability (LNG disruption from Strait of Hormuz, oil supply risk) is bearish for the euro. But Germany's massive fiscal stimulus and the euro's role as a secondary reserve currency could provide support. The EU called for "maximum restraint" while the UK granted permission for U.S. use of military bases.

### USD/JPY — BOJ Tightening vs. Safe-Haven Flows

**Friday Close (Feb 27):**
- **USD/JPY:** ~156.10, down 0.18%
- The Bank of Japan is expected to raise rates approximately twice annually through 2026-2027
- Former BOJ Governor Kuroda suggested 157 represents excessive yen weakness

**Iran Crisis Impact:** The yen was "little changed" in initial weekend trading despite the risk-off environment — suggesting the market sees BOJ tightening as a more dominant force than geopolitical safe-haven flows for the yen. The Swiss franc edged higher, taking the traditional safe-haven bid instead.

### GBP/USD — Sterling Under Pressure

**Friday Close (Feb 27):**
- **GBP/USD:** ~1.3475, up 0.01%
- Sterling slipped below $1.35 earlier in February after Labour lost a special district election, fueling concerns over PM Starmer's leadership
- UK GfK Consumer Confidence dropped unexpectedly in February
- Traders pricing in BoE rate cuts following softer employment data
- Sterling fell more than 3% from its yearly high, breaking below the February opening range

**Iran Crisis Impact:** UK granted permission for U.S. to use British military bases for strikes on Iran. Sterling faces risk from energy price shocks (UK is a net energy importer) and broader risk-off sentiment.

### EM Currencies — Risk-Off Rout Expected Monday

- Emerging-market currencies and stocks slumped in early Asian trading Monday as the Iran conflict and surging oil prices weigh on risky assets
- Oil-importing EM economies (India, Turkey, South Africa) face the worst pressure from higher energy costs
- Oil exporters with non-Hormuz exposure (Brazil, West Africa) could benefit
- The South African rand faces a test: USD/ZAR downtrend confronts USD strength from Iran crisis, but ZAR also benefits from gold at record highs
- **Iranian rial:** Already in freefall before the strikes, hitting 1.47M rials per dollar in January 2026. The economic collapse that preceded the military strikes was itself a catalyst for the conflict

## Weekend Developments — Full Situational Summary

### U.S.-Israel Strikes on Iran (February 28-March 1, 2026)

**What happened:**
1. On February 28, the U.S. and Israel launched joint strikes on Iran, targeting military facilities, commanders, and the supreme leadership
2. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed, along with the Chief of Staff, Head of the Revolutionary Guards, and other senior officials
3. Iran retaliated with an unprecedented wave of missiles and drones targeting Israel and Gulf states hosting U.S. military installations (UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan)
4. Three American troops killed in the retaliatory strikes; Trump said more casualties "likely"
5. Missiles struck several oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz
6. Iran's Revolutionary Guard issuing warnings to ships not to transit the Strait of Hormuz — de facto closure through insurance withdrawal

**Commodity Market Impact (Sunday March 1):**
| Asset | Friday Close | Weekend Price | Change |
|-------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| WTI Crude | ~$66.52 | $70.50-72.00+ | +6-8% |
| Brent Crude | ~$72.48 | $79.41 (hit $82.37) | +10-14% |
| Gold | $5,246.70 | $5,275-5,300+ | +1-2% |
| Silver | $92.06 | $94.30 | +2-3% |
| Natural Gas (Henry Hub) | ~$2.97 | Expected gap higher | TBD |
| DXY | ~97.45 | ~97.85+ | +0.4% |

**What to watch Monday:**
1. **Strait of Hormuz status** — Full closure vs. partial restriction vs. reopening determines whether oil hits $90-100+ or retreats
2. **Iranian leadership succession** — Who controls Iran's military response apparatus
3. **OPEC+ spare capacity activation** — Saudi Arabia and UAE have ~3.5M bpd spare capacity but cannot deploy it if Hormuz is blocked
4. **U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve** — Potential emergency release to cap prices
5. **Fed and central bank responses** — Higher oil = inflationary, complicating rate cut expectations
6. **Insurance markets** — War risk premiums for Persian Gulf shipping will determine how quickly trade normalizes
7. **China and Russia positioning** — CNBC reports Iran's allies may "lash out harder" in response

### Supreme Court Tariff Ruling (February 20)

- SCOTUS struck down IEEPA tariffs (6-3), which accounted for ~70% of U.S. tariff architecture and drove the average rate from 2.6% to 16.9%
- Trump immediately imposed a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act for 150 days (through July 24, 2026)
- **Exemptions:** Energy products, critical minerals, currency metals/bullion, fertilizers, and certain agricultural products
- Average effective tariff rate remains at 9.1% — highest since 1946 excluding 2025
- This tariff overhang was already weighing on commodity demand before the Iran crisis added supply-side disruption

### OPEC+ March 1 Meeting

- Emergency meeting resulted in a 206,000 bpd production increase for April — above the expected 137,000 bpd
- The increase is widely viewed as insufficient to offset potential loss of Iranian/Gulf barrels if Hormuz remains disrupted
- OPEC+ signaled willingness to deploy more spare capacity if the situation warrants
