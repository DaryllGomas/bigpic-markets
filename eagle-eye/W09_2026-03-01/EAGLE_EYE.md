## This Week's Take

The United States and Israel struck Iran on Saturday, February 28, killing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and hitting over 1,000 targets across the country. Iran has retaliated with an unprecedented wave of strikes across the Middle East, Hezbollah has fired rockets into northern Israel for the first time since the November 2024 ceasefire, and the Strait of Hormuz is under de facto closure via insurance withdrawal and IRGC radio warnings. Three American troops have been killed. There is zero de-escalation as of Sunday evening. This is the most significant geopolitical shock since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and it will dominate Monday's open and likely the weeks ahead.

The trading week ending February 27 was already ugly before the strikes. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their worst monthly performance since March 2025, driven by AI spending skepticism (the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF fell 10% in February alone), hot PPI data on Friday, and a persistent rotation out of mega-cap tech into value, energy, materials, and staples. NVIDIA delivered the cleanest earnings beat in semiconductor history — $68.1B revenue (+73% YoY), Q1 guide of $78B crushing $72.8B consensus — yet the broader market couldn't sustain a tech rally. The market was already fragile. Now add a war.

The bond market was the week's winner. The 10-year yield broke below 4% for the first time in four months (3.97%), the 2-year hit its lowest since August 2022 (3.38%), and February was the best month for bonds in a year. But the hawkish January FOMC minutes — with several officials entertaining rate hikes — and Kevin Warsh's formal nomination as Fed Chair signal a structural regime change at the central bank. The Iran crisis adds a dangerous variable: higher oil is inflationary, but a growth scare is disinflationary. The March 18 FOMC with the first 2026 dot plot falls in Triple Witch week (March 20) — a convergence of positioning flows and policy risk that could define Q1.

## Weekend & Breaking Developments

### U.S.-Israel Strikes on Iran (February 28–March 1, 2026)

**What happened:**
1. Saturday Feb 28: U.S. and Israel launched joint strikes on Iran — "Operation Epic Fury" (U.S.) / "Operation Roaring Lion" (Israel). 1,000+ targets hit including IRGC command-and-control, missile sites, submarines, and communications infrastructure.
2. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei killed, along with the Chief of Staff, Head of the Revolutionary Guards, and other senior officials.
3. Iran retaliated with missiles and drones targeting Israel and Gulf states hosting U.S. military installations (UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan).
4. Three American troops killed. Trump acknowledged more casualties "likely."
5. Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel — first since November 2024 ceasefire.
6. Missiles struck several oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz. IRGC issuing warnings to ships not to transit.
7. Strait of Hormuz under de facto closure — insurance withdrawal has effectively halted commercial shipping. At least 13 LNG tankers diverted.

**Sunday night futures (6 PM ET open):**
| Asset | Level | Change |
|---|---|---|
| S&P 500 futures | ~6,810 | -1.0% |
| Dow futures | ~48,490 | -500 pts (-1.0%) |
| Nasdaq 100 futures | — | -1.0% |
| WTI crude | ~$72 | +7.4% from Friday |
| Brent crude | ~$80 (hit $82.37) | +12% from Friday |
| Gold | ~$5,300+ | +1.5-2% |
| BTC | ~$68,000 | +3% (recovered from $63K Saturday low) |
| DXY | ~97.85 | +0.4% safe-haven bid |

**What to watch Monday:**
1. **Strait of Hormuz status** — full closure vs. partial restriction determines whether oil hits $100+ or retreats
2. **Iranian succession** — who controls the military response apparatus
3. **OPEC+ spare capacity** — 3.5M bpd available but can't deploy if Hormuz is blocked
4. **U.S. SPR release** — potential emergency draw to cap prices
5. **Fed response** — higher oil = inflationary, complicating rate cut expectations
6. **Insurance markets** — war risk premiums for Persian Gulf shipping

## Sector Heatmap

| Sector | ETF | Weekly Trend | Feb Trend | Monday Outlook |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Energy** | XLE | Modest | YTD leader | Surging — Iran/oil direct beneficiary |
| **Materials** | XLB | Outperforming | YTD leader | Beneficiary — gold, copper bid |
| **Consumer Staples** | XLP | Outperforming | YTD leader | Defensive rotation target |
| **Utilities** | XLU | Outperforming | Data center demand | Defensive + nuclear energy story |
| **Industrials** | XLI | Mixed | — | Defense sub-sector surging (LMT, RTX, NOC) |
| **Healthcare** | XLV | Mixed | — | Defensive haven |
| **Financials** | XLF | -2.1% | Sharp decline | Pressured by rate uncertainty |
| **Real Estate** | XLRE | Mixed | Rate sensitive | Bond rally supportive |
| **Communication** | XLC | Weak | Tech-adjacent drag | Risk-off pressure |
| **Technology** | XLK | -1.7% | Worst Feb performer | AI skepticism + risk-off = double headwind |

**Rotation theme:** The great rotation from mega-cap tech into value/energy/materials/staples intensified throughout February. The Iran crisis pours gasoline on this trade. Expect sharp Monday rotation into defense (LMT, RTX, NOC, LHX), energy (XOM, CVX, XLE), and gold, with risk-off selling in high-beta tech, small-caps, and speculative growth.

## Fed & Rates Outlook

**The hawkish surprise:** January FOMC minutes (released Feb 18) were the most hawkish in years — several officials entertained rate hikes, most warned inflation risk is "meaningful." The 10-2 dissent split reveals deep division between hawks worried about entrenched inflation and doves focused on labor market softening.

**Warsh nomination:** Kevin Warsh's formal Senate transmission (Feb 24) as Fed Chair replacement for Powell (term expires May 15) signals a "sound money" regime change. Markets pricing aggressive QT alongside potential front-loaded rate cuts.

**Fed speaker lean (week of Feb 24-28):**
| Speaker | Lean | Key Message |
|---|---|---|
| Waller | Dovish | Only dove. May "skip a cut" but 2025 jobs data "very weak." |
| Bostic | Hawkish | "No rate cuts penciled in for 2026." |
| Collins | Neutral-Hawkish | "Patient and deliberate approach appropriate." |
| Musalem | Neutral-Hawkish | "Unadvisable to lower into accommodative territory." |

**Rate pricing:** March ~77% hold / ~23% cut. June earliest likely cut. 2-3 cuts (50-75 bps) by year-end. Wide distribution — 16.6% see one cut, 30.6% see two, 29.1% see three.

**Iran complication:** Higher oil = inflationary (supports hawkish hold). Growth scare = disinflationary (supports cuts). The March 18 FOMC with the first 2026 dot plot will be critical. It falls in Triple Witch week — positioning flows + policy risk convergence.

**Credit watch:** IG spreads widened from 3-decade low of 71 bps OAS (Jan) to ~78-82 bps. HY showing quality bifurcation (BB tightening, CCC widening). Private credit ($2T market) facing DOJ/SEC scrutiny, AI-driven software defaults, and Jamie Dimon warnings about "dumb things" in risky lending. This is the emerging fault line.

**Liquidity:** TGA elevated at ~$849B (mild drain). ON RRP near depletion — QT now hitting bank reserves directly. Mixed picture overall.

## Commodities & Forex Snapshot

**Energy (the Iran variable):**
- WTI: $67.02 Fri → ~$72 Sunday (+7.4%). Brent: ~$71.50 Fri → ~$80 Sunday (hit $82.37, +12%).
- Strait of Hormuz de facto closed. 20% of global oil transits this chokepoint.
- OPEC+ agreed to 206K bpd increase for April — market dismisses as insufficient if Hormuz stays blocked.
- Analyst targets: Citi $80-90 near-term, Barclays warns $100/bbl, UBS flags $120+ on prolonged Hormuz disruption.
- EIA inventory draw 9.0M barrels pre-crisis. Market was already tightening.
- LNG trade through Hormuz effectively halted — 13+ tankers diverted. European gas prices expected to gap higher Monday.

**Metals:**
- Gold: ~$5,247 Fri → past $5,300 Sunday. +22% YTD. Central bank buying + dollar weakness + safe-haven surge.
- Silver: $92.06 Fri → $94.30 Sunday (+7.67%). Dual precious/industrial play outperforming gold.
- Copper: ~$5.90/lb. Structural deficit 330K MT (JPM). Balancing supply tightness vs. China demand weakness.
- Uranium: $88-96/lb range, +30% YoY. Iran crisis validates nuclear energy security thesis.

**Forex:**
- DXY: 97.45, down 7.2% YoY. Modest safe-haven bid from Iran but 14-year record bear positioning limits upside.
- EUR/USD: 1.1818. Germany's EUR 1T fiscal package supportive but European energy vulnerability is headwind.
- USD/JPY: 156.10. BOJ tightening expectations dominating over safe-haven flows.
- GBP/USD: 1.3475. UK net energy importer — vulnerable to oil shock.
- EM currencies: Slumping on risk-off. Oil importers (India, Turkey, South Africa) most vulnerable.

**Agricultural:** Corn +2.71%, soybeans +8.44%, wheat +45 cents in February. Higher energy costs from Iran will pressure farm input costs but support crop prices.

- **ETH: ~$2,000** — Dropped to $1,750 Saturday, recovered 7.5% Sunday. Continues underperforming BTC. Fusaka/Glamsterdam upgrade (full danksharding) targeted Q2/Q3 2026.
- **SOL** led Sunday recovery (+10.8% to ~$86). AVAX at ~$8.50 under severe pressure.
- **DeFi milestones:** Aave crossed $1T cumulative lending volume. Uniswap voted to expand fee switch to 8 L2 networks (UNI +15%). TVL holding $105-130B — "quiet strength" vs. spot declines.
- **ETF flows:** BTC ETFs +$1.1B over 3 days (Feb 24-26), IBIT +$652M. Small -$27.5M outflow Friday. IBIT cumulative $61.8B. Flows NOT signaling capitulation despite 47% drawdown. ETH ETFs net negative for February.
- **Liquidations:** ~$645M in 24hr crypto liquidations over weekend, majority shorts — powerful short squeeze on Sunday recovery.
- **Regulation:** SEC Chair Atkins executing dramatic pivot — "Project Crypto" joint SEC/CFTC framework, token taxonomy, innovation exemptions, tokenized money market fund approvals. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve holds ~328K BTC but active accumulation stalled on legal issues.

## The Week Ahead (March 2–6)

### Economic Data
| Date | Event | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Mon Mar 2 | ISM Manufacturing | Leading indicator for industrial activity — watch for Iran/oil impact on outlook |
| Wed Mar 4 | ISM Services | Dominant sector of the economy |
| Fri Mar 6 | Nonfarm Payrolls | Most market-moving data point. Weak print → accelerates bond rally + June cut odds |

### Earnings
- Limited major earnings this week. Focus shifts to macro/geopolitical.

### Key Events
| Date | Event | Thesis Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Mon Mar 2 | Markets open post-Iran strikes | Defense, energy, gold surge. Tech, risk-off selling. |
| Thu Mar 6 | Artemis II crewed lunar launch | Space thesis catalyst (LUNR, RKLB, PL) |
| Mar 9+ | Triple Witch positioning begins (T-9) | Pre-expiration rally averages +0.82% T-9 to T-1, but geopolitical risk may overwhelm |
| Mar 17-18 | FOMC meeting + first 2026 dot plot + SEP | Most consequential near-term rates event. Iran complicates outlook. |
| Mar 20 | Triple Witch + S&P Rebalance | Massive convergence window |

### Thesis Catalysts
- **Defense:** Iran engagement validates order books in real-time. LMT, RTX, NOC immediate beneficiaries.
- **Nuclear:** Energy security concerns viscerally apparent. Nuclear = 24/7 baseload immune to Hormuz disruption.
- **Critical Minerals:** Copper structural deficit deepens. FCX Grasberg restart Q2 2026.
- **Quantum:** IONQ earnings momentum. HON Quantinuum IPO at $20B+ expected.
- **Cybersecurity:** AI scare selloff may create entry points if overdone (ZS -12.3%, CRWD -8%).

---

## Positioning & Thesis Update

**Near-term (1-2 weeks):**
- **Risk-off dominant.** Monday opens with defense/energy/gold bid and tech/risk selling. The market was already fragile — worst February since 2025, deteriorating breadth, 65% above 200-DMA and declining. Iran is a force multiplier on existing weakness.
- **Key binary:** Strait of Hormuz. Open = contained shock (historical geopolitical dip recovery applies). Closed = 1973 territory (abort dip-buy thesis, oil $100+, stagflation risk).
- **Geopolitical shock dip-buy playbook:** Historical backtests show SPY 100% WR at 1 month, NVDA #1 recovery asset (+12.9%, 78% WR), Day 5 delayed entry optimal (+8.5% 60d return). But this only applies if the conflict is contained.
- **Defense rotation:** Immediate. LMT, RTX, NOC, LHX will gap up Monday. This is not a trade, it's a regime shift in defense spending expectations.

**Mid-term (1-3 months):**
- **March FOMC (Mar 18)** will set the tone. First 2026 dot plot. If median shifts hawkish (1-2 cuts from 2-3), it validates the "higher for longer" narrative and pressures growth/duration. If Iran triggers a growth scare, dots could surprise dovish.
- **Private credit is the sleeper risk.** $2T market with DOJ scrutiny, AI-driven software defaults, and CCC spread widening. If hidden losses cascade into forced selling, it amplifies any geopolitical-driven correction.
- **Warsh confirmation** process begins. "Sound money" Fed Chair = structural regime change. Bear steepening of the yield curve is the market's first draft of the new normal.

**What changed this week:**
- Iran strikes fundamentally altered the risk landscape. Energy security is no longer theoretical — it's viscerally real with tankers being hit and Hormuz functionally closed.
- February confirmed the rotation from tech leadership to value/energy/materials. This trend accelerates.
- NVIDIA proved the AI infrastructure build is real ($68.1B), but the "4% monetization problem" ($600B+ infra spend vs. ~$25B AI service revenue) keeps the market skeptical.
- Bond rally and falling yields are directionally supportive of growth/duration, but the Warsh nomination introduces structural uncertainty about future monetary policy.

**Risks:**
1. **Hormuz sustained closure** → oil $100+, stagflation, global recession risk
2. **Iran conflict escalation** → broader regional war, multiple front engagement
3. **Private credit contagion** → forced selling of liquid assets, credit tightening
4. **Hawkish March dot plot** → growth stocks repriced lower
5. **AI monetization disappointment** → infrastructure spend questioned, semis selloff
