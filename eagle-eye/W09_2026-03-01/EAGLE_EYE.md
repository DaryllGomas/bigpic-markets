# Eagle Eye Weekly Macro Report
## Week 9 — Week Ending 2026-02-27 | Published 2026-03-01

## This Week's Take

The week ending February 27 was a decisive inflection toward risk-off. Hot January PPI data (+0.5% MoM headline vs. +0.3% expected) collided with growing "AI fatigue" — epitomized by NVIDIA's paradoxical selloff (-5.5%) despite blowout earnings ($68.1B revenue, +73% YoY) — and unresolved US-Iran nuclear talks to produce broad equity weakness. The S&P 500 closed at 6,878.88 (-0.4%), the Dow shed 521 points (-1.05%), and the Russell 2000 fell -1.9% as small caps bore the brunt of tightening fears. The defining feature was a pronounced defensive rotation: utilities, staples, healthcare, and energy outperformed while technology and financials lagged. Seven of eleven sector ETFs recorded outflows. International markets, led by European indices at record highs, dramatically outperformed the US for the ninth consecutive month.

The bond market told a growth-scare story. The 10-year yield broke decisively below 4% to 3.97% (-11 bps weekly), while the 2-year plunged to 3.38% (-36 bps) — its lowest since August 2022. The 2s10s spread exploded to +59 bps, the widest since January 2022, in a textbook bull steepening that signals the market pricing in economic weakness faster than the Fed is willing to acknowledge. Treasuries posted their best month in a year (+1.5% Bloomberg Treasury Index). Yet the Fed remains hawkish: Goolsbee, Bostic, and Collins all emphasized patience, with CME FedWatch pricing a 94% chance of a March hold. Only Governor Waller — who revealed potentially alarming payroll revisions suggesting 2025 employment may have actually declined — leaned dovish. The tension between the bond market's growth-scare pricing and the Fed's inflation-fighting posture is the dominant macro dynamic heading into the March 17-18 FOMC meeting and its first 2026 dot plot.

Commodities confirmed the risk-off/inflation-hedging dynamic. Gold surged to ~$5,226-5,247/oz (+2.5-3% weekly, +20% YTD, +83% YoY) on central bank buying, safe-haven demand, and dollar weakness. WTI crude rose to $67.02 (+3.2%) on the Iran diplomatic breakdown. Critical minerals flashed supply-side catalysts: Zimbabwe's surprise lithium export ban spiked prices +5.4%, and NdPr rare earths hit $123/kg (+14% weekly) — crossing the $110/kg threshold that triggers US government price support for MP Materials. In crypto, Bitcoin held flat at ~$66,000-$68,000 (+0.6%) but Bitcoin ETFs saw a critical $787M inflow reversal after five weeks of outflows, while AI tokens (TAO, FET, RENDER) were notable outperformers amid the broader altcoin weakness.

## Fed & Rates Outlook

**Current Rate:** 3.50-3.75% (held Jan 28; 10-2 vote, Waller dissented for a cut)

### Treasury Curve

| Maturity | Feb 27 Close | Weekly Change | Note |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------|
| 2-Year | 3.38% | -36 bps | Lowest since Aug 2022 |
| 5-Year | 3.57% | -12 bps | — |
| 10-Year | 3.97% | -11 bps | Broke below 4% (4-month low) |
| 30-Year | 4.63% | -9 bps | — |

**Yield Curve:** 2s10s at +59 bps (widest since Jan 2022, up +25 bps WoW). Classic bull steepening — front end pricing cuts aggressively while long end held up by residual inflation fears. 3m10y at +31 bps, narrowing.

**Fed Speakers:** Hawkish-hold tone dominated. Goolsbee ("3% inflation is not good enough"), Bostic ("no rush to cut"), Collins ("quite likely to hold for some time"), Barkin and Musalem ("well positioned"). Waller was the dove outlier — March cut "a coin flip," flagged 2025 payroll revisions may show employment actually fell.

**Market Pricing (CME FedWatch):**
- March 18: 94% hold — near certainty
- June 17: ~50-50 for first cut
- Year-end: Three cuts (75 bps) to 2.75-3.00% is the base case

**Credit:** IG OAS flat at ~77 bps (2nd percentile, near historic tights). HY OAS widened modestly to ~294 bps (+8 bps). No stress signals. SLOOS shows stable lending standards, strengthening demand.

**Liquidity:** QT ended Dec 1, 2025 (Fed assets ~$6.6T, stable). ON RRP drained to near zero. TGA drew down ~$100B to ~$849B (seasonal). No funding market stress.

**Key Watch:** March 17-18 FOMC is the most consequential meeting of 2026 — first dot plot, new SEP projections. Warsh confirmation hearings in March add policy uncertainty.

## The Week Ahead

### Economic Data Releases
- **PCE Inflation** (Feb 28 / next week follow-through) — the Fed's preferred inflation gauge; critical for March FOMC calibration
- **ISM Manufacturing & Services** — growth pulse check
- **Nonfarm Payrolls** (first Friday of March) — Waller flagged Feb jobs as the "decision point" for March; payroll revisions suggesting 2025 employment declined make this the most-watched report of the quarter
- **Consumer Confidence follow-through** — Feb Conference Board showed deterioration

### Earnings
- Remaining Q4 season stragglers
- Broadcom (AVGO) — custom silicon / AI infrastructure bellwether
- Watch for any pre-announcements or guidance revisions from AI-adjacent names

### Fed Speakers
- Pre-FOMC blackout period approaches (begins March 8 for the March 17-18 meeting)
- Any final speeches before blackout will be closely watched for March guidance
- Warsh confirmation hearings could begin in March — a structural catalyst for rate expectations

### Thesis Catalysts
- **Space:** Artemis II launch targeted for March 6 — catalyst for LUNR, RKLB, LMT space segment
- **Nuclear:** NexGen (NXE) CNSC permitting decision follow-through; Constellation Calpine acquisition updates
- **Critical Minerals:** Zimbabwe lithium ban implementation and market impact monitoring; NdPr pricing above $110/kg DOD trigger — watch MP Materials
- **Quantum:** IonQ momentum post-earnings (+20%); SkyWater acquisition integration
- **AI Infrastructure:** Post-NVDA selloff stabilization watch; AVGO earnings as next AI capex data point
- **Cybersecurity:** ZS recovery watch after -12.3% drop; AI-disruption narrative durability test

## Positioning & Thesis Update

### Key Takeaways

1. **The AI Fatigue Rotation Is Real.** NVIDIA's selloff despite blowout earnings signals a sentiment regime change from "promise" to "proof." The rotation into defensives (XLU, XLP, XLV) is the most aggressive since 2022. This doesn't invalidate the AI infrastructure thesis — capex is still growing — but it shifts the alpha opportunity from mega-cap AI semis to AI infrastructure beneficiaries with less crowded positioning (VRT, CEG, DELL, ANET).

2. **Bond Market vs. Fed: Something Has to Give.** The 2s10s at +59 bps and three cuts priced by year-end directly contradicts the Fed's hawkish-hold posture. The March FOMC dot plot will either validate the bond market's growth-scare pricing or force a painful repricing of rate expectations. Waller's payroll revision data is the canary — if February jobs confirm weakness, the Fed will face a genuine dual-mandate tension for the first time this cycle.

3. **Critical Minerals Supply Shocks Are Accelerating.** Zimbabwe's lithium ban and NdPr crossing the $110/kg DOD trigger within the same week is not a coincidence — it reflects a global scramble for supply chain security. The One Big Beautiful Bill's $7.5B critical minerals allocation, DRC cobalt quotas, and rare earth price-floor mechanisms are creating a structural re-rating catalyst for MP, ALB, FCX, UUUU. These supply-side shocks are not priced into consensus.

4. **Crypto Bottoming Signals.** Bitcoin ETF flow reversal ($787M after 5 weeks of outflows), BTC RSI at 37 (oversold), and the regulatory tailwind from Project Crypto suggest a bottoming process. However, the broader risk-off environment and -46% drawdown from ATH mean patience is warranted. The AI token basket (TAO, FET, RENDER) is the highest-conviction crypto sub-theme given the AI capex overlay.

5. **Defense Remains the Steadiest Hand.** LMT +2.7%, RTX stable, NOC stable — defense primes are delivering the consistent performance expected of the thesis during a risk-off week. The $194B+ backlogs, bipartisan spending support, and rate-cut tailwind (lower discount rate on long-duration cash flows) make this the most defensible position in the portfolio heading into March uncertainty.

### Actionable Positioning
- **Add on weakness:** AI infrastructure Tier 2 names (VRT, MRVL, CEG) if the AI fatigue selloff deepens; these are operationally derisked with real backlogs
- **Monitor closely:** Critical minerals (MP, ALB) for follow-through on Zimbabwe/NdPr catalysts
- **Hold conviction:** Defense (LMT, RTX, NOC), nuclear (CEG, CCJ), and uranium (CCJ, UUUU) through the volatility
- **Watch for entry:** Crypto (BTC, AI tokens) if March jobs data confirms Waller's dovish thesis and rate-cut expectations firm up
- **Hedge awareness:** VIX at 19.86 is elevated but not extreme — hedges are available but not cheap; prefer defensive sector allocation over options overlay at current vol levels
