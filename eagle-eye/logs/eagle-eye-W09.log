| `VERIFICATION.md` | **Conditional pass** — 3 corrections applied in compilation |
| `EAGLE_EYE.md` | Final compiled report |

**Verification found 3 corrections** (all applied in the final report):
1. BTC price — used range ($66K-$68K) instead of imprecise close figure
2. March FOMC probability — used Report 02's 94% hold (Report 03 had an erroneous 60% hold)
3. BTC ETF AUM — used $130B (Report 04 had a $834B typo)

**Top-line for the week:** Risk-off driven by hot PPI, NVDA sell-the-news, and Iran. SPX -0.4%, 10Y broke below 4% to 3.97%, gold +2.5-3% to $5,226-5,247/oz, BTC flat but ETFs reversed with +$787M inflows. Critical minerals catalysts accelerating (Zimbabwe lithium ban, NdPr crosses DOD price trigger).
