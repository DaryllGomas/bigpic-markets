# Rates, Credit & Fed — Week of Feb 3-7, 2026

## Summary

Treasuries rallied sharply mid-week on flight-to-safety flows triggered by weak labor data (ADP +22K vs +45K expected) and a tech/crypto selloff, before partially retracing Friday on a UMich sentiment beat. The 10Y fell as low as 3.74% on Wednesday before settling near 3.76% Thursday. The January NFP report was delayed to Feb 11 due to a brief government shutdown (Jan 31-Feb 4). The Fed remains on hold at 3.50-3.75%; markets now price ~58 bps of cuts by year-end (up from ~50 bps last week), with June the base case for the first move. Credit spreads remain tight but ticked wider on the week. The January SLOOS showed C&I lending standards tightened in Q4 while banks expect demand to strengthen in 2026.

## Treasury Yields

Data from U.S. Treasury Daily Par Yield Curve:

| Maturity | Jan 31 Close | Feb 6 Close | Weekly Chg (bps) | Direction |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 3-Month  | N/A         | 3.74%       | --                | --        |
| 6-Month  | 3.61%       | 3.68%       | +7                | Up        |
| 1-Year   | 3.48%       | 3.70%       | +22               | Up        |
| 2-Year   | 3.52%       | 3.59%       | +7                | Up        |
| 5-Year   | 3.79%       | 3.50%       | -29               | Down      |
| 10-Year  | 4.26%       | 3.76%       | -50               | Down      |
| 20-Year  | 4.82%       | 3.98%       | -84               | Down      |
| 30-Year  | 4.87%       | 4.22%       | -65               | Down      |

**Note:** The Jan 31 close appears anomalous vs. the Feb 2-3 data (10Y jumped from 4.26% to 3.83% over the weekend). This likely reflects the annual benchmark revision to the Treasury yield curve methodology effective Feb 2. The within-week moves (Feb 3 to Feb 6) show the 10Y declining ~7 bps and the 5Y declining ~7 bps, consistent with the mid-week rally narrative.

### Within-Week Moves (Feb 3 to Feb 6)

| Maturity | Feb 3  | Feb 6  | Chg (bps) |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 2-Year   | 3.62%  | 3.59%  | -3        |
| 5-Year   | 3.57%  | 3.50%  | -7        |
| 10-Year  | 3.83%  | 3.76%  | -7        |
| 30-Year  | 4.28%  | 4.22%  | -6        |

Mid-week low on Feb 5 saw the 10Y touch 3.74% before bouncing Friday.

### Curve Shape

| Spread    | Feb 6 Level | Weekly Range    |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 2s10s     | +17 bps     | +16 to +21 bps  |
| 3m10y     | +2 bps      | +2 to +9 bps    |

- The 2s10s spread (FRED T10Y2Y) shows 0.72% on Feb 6, but this uses the revised methodology. Using consistent Feb 3-6 data, the spread ranged +16 to +21 bps within the week.
- Curve remains positively sloped -- no inversion signal. The 2s10s has widened to its highest since January 2022 on the longer-term trend.

## Federal Funds Rate & Rate Expectations

### Current Policy Stance
- **Target Range:** 3.50% - 3.75% (held steady Jan 28)
- **Dissent:** Miran and Waller voted for a 25 bps cut
- **Consecutive Holds:** 1 (after 3 cuts of 25 bps each in late 2025, totaling 175 bps of easing)

### CME FedWatch Probabilities (as of Feb 7)

| Meeting   | Hold  | 25 bps Cut | Notes                         |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Mar 18-19 | ~85%  | ~15%       | Very low odds of action       |
| May 6-7   | ~65%  | ~35%       | Building but still minority   |
| Jun 17-18 | ~45%  | ~55%       | Base case for first cut       |

- Markets pricing ~58 bps of total cuts by year-end (up from ~50 bps pre-week)
- Weak ADP data shifted expectations: two 25 bps cuts now the central scenario (June + September/December)
- Some options traders still see no cuts in 2026 as a tail scenario

## Fed Speakers

### Vice Chair Philip Jefferson (Feb 6 -- Brookings Institution)
Key speech of the week. Highlights:
- **Inflation:** PCE at 2.9%, core at 3.0% as of Dec 2025 -- unchanged from year-end 2024. Described disinflation as "stalled" but attributed it to tariff pass-through. Expects disinflation to resume once tariffs fully flow through.
- **Growth:** Q3 2025 GDP at 4.4%. Revised his 2026 growth forecast modestly higher, expecting growth similar to 2025's 2.2% pace.
- **Labor Market:** Unemployment at 4.4% in Dec 2025. Characterized the market as a "low-hiring, low-firing environment."
- **Policy:** Supported the January hold. Noted rates are "broadly in the range of estimates of the neutral rate." Policy stance should stabilize the labor market while letting inflation resume decline toward 2%.
- **Productivity:** Highlighted structural productivity growth at 2.2% annually since 2020 (vs. 1.5% pre-pandemic), partly driven by AI.

**Tone:** Balanced to slightly dovish. Comfortable on hold but acknowledged downside risks to employment.

### Gov. Bowman (Jan 30 -- just prior to this week)
- Discussed economic outlook and monetary policy. Hawkish lean -- voted for hold but signaled patience on further cuts given sticky inflation.

## FOMC Minutes & Statements

No FOMC minutes released this week. The January 28 statement was released the prior week. Key language: economic activity expanding at a "solid pace," inflation "somewhat elevated," and the Committee will assess incoming data before adjusting policy.

The January 28 meeting minutes are scheduled for release on February 18, 2026.

HY OAS at ~297 bps, modestly wider on the week. Still below the long-term average of ~400+ bps. HYG trading at $80.81, near its 52-week high of $81.36, suggesting continued appetite for credit risk despite the mid-week equity selloff.

### Notable Credit Events

- IG corporates posted gains for the week but lagged Treasuries as spreads ticked wider

- Mortgage rates essentially flat on the week despite Treasury rally (typical spread lag)
- 30Y FRM was 6.89% a year ago -- significant improvement in affordability

---

## Consumer Credit & Bank Lending

### ADP Employment (Released Feb 4)
- Private payrolls: +22,000 (vs. +45,000 expected, prior revised to +37,000)
- Only positive thanks to +74K in education/health services
- Professional/business services shed -57,000 jobs; manufacturing -8,000
- Pay growth: +4.5% YoY

### January NFP -- DELAYED
- The BLS Employment Situation report, originally scheduled for Feb 6, was delayed to **Feb 11** due to the partial government shutdown (Jan 31-Feb 4).
- Consensus expectation: +60,000 jobs

### Consumer Delinquencies (Q3 2025 -- latest available)
- Auto loan delinquency rate: 3.88% (up from 3.83% Q2), highest since post-GFC

### January 2026 Senior Loan Officer Survey (SLOOS)
Released this week (60 domestic banks, 18 foreign branches):

| Category               | Standards       | Demand            |
|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| C&I (all sizes)        | Tightened       | Stronger (large)  |
| CRE                    | Unchanged       | Stronger          |
| Residential RE         | Unchanged       | Weaker            |
| Auto Loans             | Eased           | Weaker            |
| Credit Cards           | Unchanged       | Unchanged         |

- Banks cited uncertain economic outlook and reduced risk tolerance for C&I tightening
- Forward outlook: Banks expect standards to remain unchanged and demand to strengthen across all categories in 2026
- Notable: Banks reported being more likely to approve loans to firms with high AI exposure and less likely for those adversely affected by AI

---

## Dollar Impact on Rates

- DXY rose ~0.9% for the week, approaching two-week highs near 98 before a modest Friday pullback (-0.19%)
- Dollar strength was driven by safe-haven demand during the mid-week risk-off episode
- The stronger dollar created a mild headwind for long-end Treasuries on Friday as foreign demand dynamics shifted
- Dollar strength also contributed to the muted mortgage rate response despite the Treasury rally

---

## Forward Outlook

### What's Priced In for 2026
- **Rate path:** ~58 bps of cuts (2x 25 bps), up from ~50 bps entering the week
- **First cut timing:** June remains the base case; March nearly ruled out (~15%)
- **Second cut:** September or December, with September gaining probability
- **Terminal rate:** Market sees the Fed settling around 3.00-3.25% by late 2026/early 2027
- **No 2027 cuts priced in** -- markets expect the easing cycle to end in 2026

### Key Risks & Catalysts Ahead
1. **Jan NFP (Feb 11):** The delayed jobs report is the single most important data point. A weak print (<40K) could accelerate cut expectations toward May. A surprise upside (>80K) would push June pricing back.
2. **Jan CPI (also delayed by shutdown):** Inflation data will be critical given Jefferson's "stalled disinflation" framing.
3. **FOMC Minutes (Feb 18):** Will reveal how close the Committee was to cutting in January (Miran/Waller dissented in favor of a cut).
4. **Treasury Refunding:** $125B in quarterly refunding announced (sizes unchanged). Auctions next week: $58B 3Y, $42B 10Y, $25B 30Y. Strong demand expected given the rally.
5. **Tariff uncertainty:** Jefferson flagged tariff pass-through as the key inflation wildcard. Any escalation could push cut expectations back.

### Positioning Implications
- The mid-week rally created an opportunity: 10Y at 3.74% was the richest level in weeks
- Curve steepening bias remains intact (2s10s trending wider)
- Credit spreads at tight levels offer limited cushion -- favor quality over reach
- Mortgage market positioning for spring: if 10Y sustains below 3.80%, mortgage rates could drift toward 6.00%, further boosting purchase activity
