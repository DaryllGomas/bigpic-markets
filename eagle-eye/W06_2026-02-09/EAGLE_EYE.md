# Eagle Eye — Week of February 3-7, 2026

## This Week's Take

The Dow closed above 50,000 for the first time in history while the Nasdaq posted its worst week since April 2025 -- a tale of two markets that crystallizes the great rotation of 2026. Financials, industrials, and healthcare absorbed billions in outflows from growth and software names, with the S&P 500 equal-weight index hitting fresh all-time highs even as cap-weighted benchmarks went nowhere. The catalyst was Anthropic's Claude legal plugin, which triggered a $285B rout in software stocks on Tuesday, compounding the anxiety from Alphabet's $185B capex announcement and Amazon's earnings miss. By Friday, chipmakers staged a violent dip-buy (NVDA +7.8%, AVGO +7.2%), confirming that the AI infrastructure trade remains intact even as AI begins to directly disrupt incumbent software business models.

Beyond equities, the week delivered historic moves across every asset class. Gold surged back toward $5,000/oz as risk-off flows intensified amid a partial government shutdown that delayed the January jobs report, while ADP showed a paltry +22K private payrolls. Bitcoin suffered its worst crash since FTX, plunging from $73K to $61K on Thursday as Hong Kong hedge funds unwound leveraged IBIT options financed via the yen carry trade, before rebounding to $70K on Friday. The Fear & Greed Index hit 5, matching the TerraLUNA capitulation low. Treasury yields rallied mid-week with the 10Y touching 3.74% before settling at 3.76%, and Fed funds futures now price ~58 bps of cuts by year-end with June the base case for the first move.

The macro backdrop is fragile but not broken. The government shutdown data vacuum amplified volatility across all risk assets, and next week's delayed NFP report (Feb 11) and Fed Chair Powell's semi-annual testimony (Feb 12) will set the tone for the rest of Q1. The rotation into value and small caps is healthy breadth expansion, but the Hindenburg Omen cluster (3rd occurrence in 6 trading days) and the BTC capitulation warrant close monitoring. The uranium pullback from $101 to $85 creates a potential accumulation window ahead of the NexGen CNSC hearing Feb 9-12, and the Dow 50K milestone suggests the broadening thesis -- long the backbone of our investment approach -- is playing out.

## Fed & Rates Outlook

The Fed held at 3.50-3.75% on January 28, with Miran and Waller dissenting in favor of a 25 bps cut. The policy stance is now described as "broadly in the range of estimates of the neutral rate" per Vice Chair Jefferson's Feb 6 Brookings speech. Markets price ~58 bps of cuts by year-end (up from ~50 bps entering the week), with June the base case for the first cut (~55% probability) and a second cut in September/December.

Treasuries rallied mid-week on flight-to-safety flows as weak ADP data (+22K vs +45K expected) and the government shutdown data vacuum triggered risk-off positioning. The 10Y fell to 3.74% before settling at 3.76%. The 2s10s spread sits at +17 bps, positively sloped with no inversion signal. Credit spreads remain historically tight: IG OAS at 76 bps (well below 10-year median of ~120 bps) and HY OAS at ~297 bps. The January SLOOS showed C&I lending standards tightened in Q4, with banks notably reporting being more likely to approve loans to firms with high AI exposure.

The delayed January NFP (now Feb 11) is the single most important data point ahead. A weak print (<40K) could accelerate cut expectations toward May; a surprise upside (>80K) would push June pricing back. Fed Chair Powell's semi-annual testimony to Congress on Feb 12 will set the tone for rate expectations through Q1.

## Commodities & Forex Snapshot

**Energy:** Crude oil firmed modestly (WTI +1.7% to $63.55, Brent +1.9% to $68.05) as OPEC+ reaffirmed the pause on production increments through March and EIA reported a larger-than-expected 3.5M barrel inventory draw. Natural gas collapsed 20% after spiking mid-week to $4.88 on Winter Storm Fern, as forecasts shifted markedly warmer.

**Precious Metals:** Gold surged +5% to ~$4,980, recovering from the historic Jan 30-31 crash (-11% in one session on the Warsh Fed Chair nomination). Now approaching the $5,000 psychological barrier as risk-off flows, central bank buying, and ETF inflows provide structural support. Silver lagged at -3.9%, failing to recover as strongly.

**Uranium:** Sharp correction from $101.55 (late-Jan two-year high) to $85.25 (-6.5% on the week, -16% from the high). Kazatomprom confirmed 2026 production guidance cut to ~29,700 tU (10% below capacity), maintaining supply discipline. NexGen CNSC Rook I hearing (Feb 9-12) is the key near-term catalyst. DOE awarded $2.7B in enrichment contracts (Centrus $900M, General Matter $900M, Orano for LEU).

**Industrial Metals:** Copper fell ~4% to $5.85/lb on rising exchange inventories despite structural supply tightness. Aluminum retreated from a 3.5-year high to ~$3,100/t.

**FX:** DXY recovered +1.2% to ~97.7, bouncing from late-January multi-quarter lows on safe-haven demand. EUR/USD fell 0.8% to 1.1794, USD/JPY rose to ~156 as carry trade resumed. Yuan firmed modestly on the Trump-Xi soybean mega-deal (20M ton commitment, Feb 28 deadline for broader terms).

**Agriculture:** Soybeans rallied to $11.15/bu on the expanded US-China purchase deal. US-India oil trade deal announced (India stops buying Russian oil, tariff reduced 25% to 18%).

## Crypto Snapshot

A historic capitulation week. Bitcoin crashed from ~$73K to ~$61K on Thursday -- the worst intraday plunge since FTX -- before rebounding +10% to ~$69,500 on Friday. The selloff was triggered by Hong Kong hedge fund blowups unwinding leveraged IBIT options financed via the yen carry trade, compounded by a winter storm knocking 40% of Bitcoin hashrate offline (largest mining difficulty drop since the 2021 China ban) and sustained institutional ETF outflows. The Fear & Greed Index hit 5, matching TerraLUNA-era lows.

Ethereum significantly underperformed at -23% on the week, with the ETH/BTC ratio continuing to compress to 0.029-0.035. ETH spot ETFs saw $447M in net outflows across five sessions.

**ETF Flows:** The BTC/ETH spot ETF complex shed ~$750M combined on the week. IBIT (BlackRock) was the only consistent positive-flow BTC ETF. Since November 2025, the spot BTC ETF complex has shed ~$6.18B net -- the longest sustained outflow streak since launch. XRP ETFs bucked the trend with +$19.5M inflows and record weekly volume.

**Stablecoin Signal:** USDT expanded +$1.05B while USDC contracted -$640M, indicating retail/offshore capital entering via Tether while institutional/regulated capital pulls back -- a bearish institutional signal.

**Regulatory:** SEC "Project Crypto" initiative launched to modernize securities rules for on-chain finance. DTC tokenization pilot approved (3-year, launching H2 2026). Stablecoin licensing framework expected by mid-2026. Regulatory environment is the most constructive in years but providing no near-term price support.

## Positioning & Thesis Update

### Near-Term (1-3 months)
- **Value rotation is the trade.** Financials (XLF +3.5%), industrials (XLI +2.8%), and small caps (Russell +3.5%) are leading. Equal-weight S&P 500 at ATH confirms breadth. Favor Dow components and financials over Nasdaq.
- **AI infrastructure dip-buying.** Friday's chip rally (NVDA +7.8%, AVGO +7.2%) shows conviction. Accumulate Tier 1 AI names on pullbacks. Software names face repricing risk as AI disrupts incumbent models.
- **Uranium accumulation window.** The pullback from $101 to $85 with supply fundamentals unchanged (Kazatomprom production cuts confirmed) and the NexGen CNSC hearing as a binary catalyst creates a tactical opportunity in CCJ, NXE, and LEU.
- **BTC: watch $65K.** A sustained break below reopens $55K-$58K. ETF flow reversal from outflows to inflows would be the clearest bullish signal. Extreme Fear readings historically mark bottoms but funding rates remain positive (longs not fully flushed).

### Medium-Term (3-12 months)
- **Nuclear thesis intact.** CEG -14% is Calpine-driven regulatory friction, not thesis deterioration. VST +5% on Meta deal visibility. The hyperscaler PPA pipeline ($50B+) is the strongest secular tailwind in the energy sector.
- **AI capex cycle has legs.** Alphabet $185B + Amazon massive guidance = infrastructure suppliers (NVDA, AVGO, VRT, ETN, GLW) are direct beneficiaries. The 4% monetization debate is front of mind but corporate spending commitments are locked in.
- **Fed easing cycle supports.** Two cuts by year-end (June + Sept/Dec) with terminal rate ~3.00-3.25% is supportive for growth equities and commodities. Gold targeting $5,000+.
- **Space economy catalyst-rich.** Artemis II (March 6), SpaceX-xAI merger lifting sector, SDA contract pipeline growing. RKLB +8% on the week leading the charge.

### What Changed This Week
1. **Dow 50K = rotation confirmed.** No longer a tentative trade -- the value rotation is the dominant market theme of early 2026.
2. **Anthropic disruption is real.** The $285B software rout marks a new phase: AI is now a direct threat to incumbent software business models, not just a future risk. Thomson Reuters -15.8%, LegalZoom -19.7%.
3. **Crypto capitulation.** Fear & Greed at 5 and the largest difficulty drop since China's 2021 ban are extreme readings. Institutional ETF outflows now span 6 months. Positioning shifted from "buy the dip" to "prove the bottom."
4. **Uranium corrected.** The $101 to $85 pullback is healthy after a 17% rally the prior week. Supply thesis unchanged. CNSC hearing is the next catalyst.
5. **Fed cut expectations shifted.** Weak ADP pushed pricing from ~50 bps to ~58 bps of cuts. June is now the clear base case.

### Risk Factors
- **Government shutdown data vacuum.** Delayed NFP and CPI create uncertainty that amplifies volatility across all asset classes.
- **Hindenburg Omen cluster.** Three occurrences in 6 trading days -- warrants monitoring despite healthy surface breadth.
- **BTC contagion.** Hong Kong hedge fund blowup could have unrevealed counterparty exposure. Funding rates still positive = more longs to liquidate.
- **Mega-cap capex returns.** The 4% monetization problem is front of mind. If AI spending doesn't translate to revenue, the capex guidance that supports infrastructure names becomes a liability.
- **Tariff escalation.** Weighted average applied tariff rate at 13.5% (highest since 1946). Feb 28 US-China deadline could go either way.
- **Uranium spot volatility.** $101 to $85 in one week demonstrates the illiquidity of the spot market. Position sizing matters.
- **CEG regulatory risk.** DOJ and FERC demanding Calpine divestitures. Earnings Feb 19 will provide management commentary on path forward.
- **Credit spreads historically tight.** IG at 76 bps and HY at 297 bps offer limited cushion if macro deteriorates.
