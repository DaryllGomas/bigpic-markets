# Commodities & Foreign Exchange — Week of Feb 3-7, 2026

## Summary

A volatile week across commodities driven by colliding macro forces: gold surged toward $5,000/oz as risk-off sentiment intensified amid a partial government shutdown and delayed jobs data; crude oil slipped on OPEC+ production stability and easing Iran tensions; uranium pulled back sharply from a two-year high near $101/lb; and the dollar recovered to ~97.7 DXY after January's slide below 97. The Trump-Xi soybean mega-deal sent agricultural futures ripping higher, while copper retreated on rising inventories despite structural supply tightness.

## Energy

### Crude Oil

| Benchmark | Close (Feb 7) | Prior Week Close | Weekly Change |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| WTI Crude | ~$63.55/bbl | ~$62.50/bbl | +1.7% |
| Brent Crude | ~$68.05/bbl | ~$66.80/bbl | +1.9% |

**Key Drivers:**
- **OPEC+ holds steady:** Eight key producers (Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, Oman) met virtually Feb 1 and reaffirmed the Nov 2025 decision to pause production increments through March 2026. The 1.65M bbl/day in voluntary cuts remains fully in place, with return "subject to evolving market conditions."
- **EIA inventories:** Feb 4 report showed a 3.455M barrel draw (vs. -2.0M expected), with US crude inventories at 422.9M barrels, ~3% below the five-year average.
- **Iran de-escalation:** Easing US-Iran tensions reduced geopolitical risk premium that had supported prices in late January (Winter Storm Fern disruptions also faded).
- **India trade deal:** Trump announced Feb 2 that India would stop buying Russian oil and increase US purchases, lowering India's reciprocal tariff from 25% to 18%.

### Natural Gas

| Benchmark | Close (Feb 6) | Prior Week Close | Weekly Change |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Henry Hub NG | ~$3.50/MMBtu | ~$4.40/MMBtu | -20% |

**Key Drivers:**
- Massive weekly swing: Henry Hub spiked to $4.875/MMBtu mid-week before collapsing as weather forecasts shifted markedly warmer for mid-February, particularly in the Northeast.
- Storage drew 360 Bcf the prior week (record withdrawal), leaving inventories 27 Bcf below the five-year average.
- Production recovering: Lower 48 output rising to ~106.6 Bcf/d in early February from suppressed January levels (Winter Storm Fern).
- EIA lowered Q1 2026 Henry Hub forecast to $3.38/MMBtu (from $4.35 last month).

## Precious Metals

### Gold

| Metal | Close (Feb 7) | Prior Week Close (~Jan 31) | Weekly Change |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Gold | ~$4,980/oz | ~$4,745/oz | +5.0% |

**Key Drivers:**
- Gold rebounded strongly this week after the historic Jan 30-31 crash (-11% on Jan 31 alone, worst day in over a decade, triggered by Kevin Warsh Fed Chair nomination and hawkish repricing).
- Surged past $4,960 on Feb 6 (+3.9% in a single session) as risk-off flows accelerated: government shutdown delayed the January jobs report, ADP showed only +22K private payrolls (vs. +45K expected), and tech sold off.
- Near the $5,000 psychological barrier by Friday; briefly hit $5,600 intra-week on Jan 30 before the crash.
- Central bank buying and gold ETF inflows remain structurally supportive. Year-to-date gold is up ~8%.

### Silver

| Metal | Close (Feb 7) | Prior Week Close | Weekly Change |
|-------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Silver | ~$78.46/oz | ~$81.67/oz | -3.9% |

Silver lagged gold this week, failing to recover as strongly from the late-January crash. Traded in a wide $75-$88 range. Up ~16% year-to-date despite the recent volatility. Industrial demand signals mixed as China manufacturing data softened.

### Platinum

| Metal | Close (Feb 6) | Prior Week Close | Weekly Change |
|-------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Platinum | ~$2,100/oz | ~$2,268/oz | -7.4% |

Platinum fell for the month, down 7.5% over the past 30 days, though still up 110% year-over-year. South African production constraints (70% of global output) provide structural floor, but elevated prices are reducing autocatalyst demand and encouraging palladium substitution. Hawkish Fed signals weighed on the complex.

## Industrial Metals

| Metal | Price (Feb 6) | Weekly Trend | Key Driver |
|-------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Copper (LME) | ~$5.85/lb (~$12,900/t) | Down ~4% | Rising inventories at Shanghai, London, New York hubs |
| Aluminum (LME) | ~$3,100/t | Down ~5% from Jan 28 high of $3,270 | Retreated from 3.5-year high; China demand uncertainty |

**Copper:** Held below $6/lb after losing nearly 4% in a single session. Goldman Sachs maintains $10,000-$11,000/t range forecast for 2026 on structural grid/power demand, but near-term weakness from rising exchange inventories and China growth concerns.

**Aluminum:** Retreated from the 3.5-year high of $3,270/t hit Jan 28 to ~$3,100. Goldman forecasts decline to $2,350/t by year-end; Bank of America sees $3,000/t in Q4. Market remains "very tight" per CNBC analysts, with clean energy and EV demand providing structural support.

## Uranium — Nuclear Energy Thesis Update

| Metric | Value | Weekly Change |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Spot Price (Feb 6) | $85.25/lb U3O8 | -6.5% (from ~$91.20) |
| End-Jan Spot (Cameco) | $94.28/lb | — |
| Recent High (late Jan) | $101.55/lb | Highest since Feb 2024 |

### Weekly Narrative

Uranium experienced a sharp correction this week after a stunning 17.3% rally the prior week ($86 to $101.55/lb). The pullback from $101.55 to $85.25 represents a ~16% decline from the intra-week high, though prices remain well above the $70-75 range from mid-2025.

### Key Developments

**Kazatomprom (KAP) — Production Discipline Continues:**
- Q4 2025 operations update released in early February confirmed 2026 production guidance at 29,697 tU, revised down from 32,777 tU (approximately 10% below capacity).
- Company cited sulfuric acid shortages and wellfield development delays as operational constraints.
- Explicitly stated that current supply-demand balance does not incentivize return to 100% production levels.
- CCJ shares fell 2.6% on the update as some investors misread the headline production figure.

**NexGen Energy (NXE) — CNSC Hearing Imminent:**
- Part 2 of the CNSC public hearing for the Rook I uranium mine and mill project begins Feb 9-12 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
- This is the largest development-stage uranium project globally (30M lbs/yr capacity).
- Part 1 (staff/company questioning) completed Nov 19, 2025. Part 2 includes Indigenous Nations, community organizations, and public interventions.
- Approval would be a major catalyst for the sector. The Athabasca Basin hosts the world's highest-grade uranium deposits.

**DOE Enrichment Awards ($2.7B):**
- DOE awarded three enrichment task orders: $900M each to Centrus Energy (American Centrifuge Operating) and General Matter for domestic HALEU capacity, plus Orano Federal Services for LEU capacity.
- Global Laser Enrichment received an additional $28M for next-gen technology.
- Centrus began domestic centrifuge manufacturing in Dec 2025 to support commercial LEU enrichment at Piketon, Ohio.
- Urenco USA authorized by NRC to enrich up to 10% U-235 (LEU+), with first deliveries planned for 2026.
- Orano targeting NRC license submission in early 2026 for Tennessee facility (LEU production by 2031).

### Thesis Implications

The uranium supply deficit thesis (30-40M lb/yr gap) remains firmly intact. Kazatomprom's continued production discipline and the spot price correction from $101 to $85 creates a potential accumulation opportunity. The NexGen CNSC hearing next week (Feb 9-12) is a near-term binary catalyst. Western enrichment capacity buildout is accelerating but remains years from bridging the Russian dependency gap (46% of global enrichment).

## Agricultural Commodities

| Commodity | Close (Feb 6) | Weekly Trend | Key Driver |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Soybeans | $11.15/bu | Strong rally | Trump-Xi 20M ton purchase deal |
| Corn | $4.30/bu (Mar) | Up modestly | Spillover from soybean optimism |
| Wheat | $5.30/bu (Mar) | Up modestly | General ag bid |

### Trump-Xi Soybean Mega-Deal

The headline event for agricultural commodities this week was the announced breakthrough in US-China soybean trade:
- Trump announced China plans to lift US soybean purchases to **20M metric tons this season** and **25M tons** annually for 2026-2028.
- China fulfilled its initial 12M ton commitment from the Oct 2025 summit, but the expanded deal sent soybean futures to two-month highs above $11/bu.
- Treasury Secretary Bessent indicated a Feb 28 deadline for completion of broader trade terms.
- Context: US had imposed reciprocal tariffs up to 125% on Chinese industrial goods; China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US agricultural exports. The soybean deal represents the key agricultural de-escalation channel.

## US Dollar Index (DXY)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DXY Close (Feb 6) | ~97.7 |
| DXY (Jan 30) | ~96.5 (multi-quarter low) |
| Weekly Change | +1.2% |

**Key Drivers:**
- Dollar recovered from late-January multi-quarter lows near 96.5 after briefly breaking below 97 (a 4-year low) on Jan 31.
- Safe-haven bid supported the greenback: government shutdown delayed the January jobs report (BLS unable to release Employment Situation data on Feb 6 as scheduled), weak ADP data (+22K vs. +45K expected), tech sell-off, and crypto decline triggered flight to safety.
- Fed Governor Lisa Cook signaled opposition to additional rate cuts; Kevin Warsh nomination as Fed Chair reinforced hawkish expectations.
- On track to end the week up ~0.9% despite structural weakness from tariff uncertainty and twin deficit concerns.

## Major FX Pairs

| Pair | Level (Feb 6) | Weekly Change | Key Driver |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| EUR/USD | 1.1794 | -0.8% | Dollar recovery on risk-off; ECB rate path dovish |
| USD/JPY | ~156 | +0.5% | Yen weakened on BoJ dovish hold; carry trade resumed |
| GBP/USD | ~1.37 | -0.6% | Sterling soft on UK growth concerns |
| USD/CNY | 6.94 | -0.3% | Yuan modestly firmer on soybean deal optimism |

**EUR/USD:** Euro retreated from recent highs as dollar safe-haven flows dominated. ECB expected to continue easing while Fed pivot delayed by Warsh appointment.

**USD/JPY:** Yen lost ground as Bank of Japan maintained dovish stance. Carry trade flows supported dollar/yen above 155.

**USD/CNY:** Yuan firmed modestly on positive trade deal headlines (soybean commitment, potential tariff de-escalation). PBOC fixing remained stable.

## Supply Chain & Trade Signals

### Baltic Dry Index

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| BDI (Feb 6) | 1,923 |
| Weekly Trend | Down 5 consecutive days |
| Monthly Change | +8.3% |
| Year-over-Year | +136% |

Segment breakdown: Capesize -1.1% (2,918), Panamax -0.4% (1,652), Supramax +0.2% (1,104). The decline reflects seasonal softening and China's Lunar New Year holiday effects on dry bulk demand, but the year-over-year surge of 136% indicates structurally stronger shipping demand.

### Trade Policy Developments

- **US-India Deal (Feb 2):** India to stop buying Russian oil, increase US purchases. Reciprocal tariff reduced from 25% to 18%.
- **US-China Soybeans:** 20M ton deal announced; Feb 28 deadline for broader terms.
- **Tariff Regime:** Weighted average applied tariff rate on all imports at 13.5% (highest since 1946). Average effective rate at 9.9% after behavioral adjustments. Estimated $1,300/household tax increase in 2026.
- **Government Shutdown:** Partial shutdown delayed January jobs report, creating data vacuum that amplified market volatility.
- **Exemption Concerns:** Senate Democrats flagged preferential tariff exemptions for "politically connected" companies (smartphones/Apple cited).
