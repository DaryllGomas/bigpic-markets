# Crypto & Alternative Assets — Week of Feb 3-7, 2026

## Week Summary

A historic week for crypto markets. Bitcoin crashed from ~$73K to a low of ~$61K (Thursday) before rebounding to ~$70K on Friday — a 15%+ intraday plunge not seen since the FTX collapse in 2022. The selloff was triggered by the implosion of Hong Kong-based hedge funds unwinding leveraged IBIT options financed via the yen carry trade, compounded by a winter storm knocking 40% of Bitcoin hashrate offline and continued institutional ETF outflows. Fear & Greed Index hit 5 — the lowest since June 2022 (TerraLUNA). Over $2B in liquidations across the week. Friday saw a sharp relief rally (+10%) but the macro picture remains fragile.

## 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

| Metric | Value | Weekly Change |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Price (Fri close) | ~$69,500 | -5% to -8% WoW |
| Intraweek Low | ~$61,000 (Thu) | -52% from ATH ($126K, Oct 2025) |
| Intraweek High | ~$73,000 (Mon) | — |
| BTC Dominance | 58.4% | -0.56% (24h) |
| Hash Rate | 863 EH/s | -11% WoW, -20% MoM |
| Mining Difficulty | 125.9T (adj. Feb 7) | -11.4% (largest drop since 2021 China ban) |
| Hashprice | <$30/PH/s | Near break-even for many miners |
| Active Addresses | 630K-750K daily | Down ~50% from 2024 bull peaks |
| New Address Creation | ~275K/day | Down sharply |
| Exchange Flows | Daily settlement ~$7.5B | Down >40% from 2024 highs |
| Avg Transaction Fee | <$0.80 | Down from >$5 in peak 2024 |

**Key Drivers:**
- Hong Kong hedge fund blowup: leveraged IBIT call options funded via yen carry trade unraveled after BoJ signaled further rate hikes
- Winter storm forced ~40% of US hashrate offline, triggering largest difficulty drop since China mining ban
- CryptoQuant reports institutional demand has "reversed materially" — ETFs that were net buyers in 2024 are now net sellers
- Whale activity collapsed: large transactions down 69.6%, whale concentration dropped from 12 to 5 mega-addresses
- On-chain: retail participation rising despite price decline, suggesting capitulation among institutions but sticky retail base

## 2. Ethereum (ETH)

| Metric | Value | Weekly Change |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Price | ~$2,200-$2,300 | -23% WoW (underperforming BTC) |
| Intraweek Low | ~$2,110 (Feb 3) | -28% over 7 days |
| ETH/BTC Ratio | 0.029-0.035 | Continued underperformance |
| Staking Yield | ~3.3% APY | Stable |
| Total ETH Staked | 35.86M (28.9% of supply) | — |
| L2 Fee Reduction | 40-60% lower vs L1 | Post-Fusaka improvement |

**Notes:**
- ETH significantly underperformed BTC and the broader market (-23% vs market -9%)
- Fusaka upgrade (activated Dec 2025) is improving L2 scalability but hasn't translated to price strength
- L2 paradox continues: lower fees are great for users but reduce direct L1 fee burn, pressuring the deflationary thesis
- Institutional staking adoption growing as ETPs offer 3-5% additional yield

---

## 3. Major Altcoins

| Token | Price (approx.) | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| SOL | ~$97 | Hit hard alongside broader market |
| ADA | Below $1.00 | Needs breakout above $1.32 for bullish reversal |
| AVAX | $13-$30 range | Tokenization narrative supporting long-term thesis |
| LINK | ~$9.72 | Oracle demand stable but price weak |
| DOT | Depressed | Minimal catalysts this week |
| MATIC | Depressed | Continued rebranding to POL; L2 competition intense |

**Observation:** Altcoins broadly underperformed BTC during the selloff. The Altcoin Season Index reads 22, confirming Bitcoin dominance and no altseason in sight.

---

## 4. Trending Narratives

- **AI x Crypto:** Remains the dominant 2026 narrative. For every VC dollar into crypto in 2025, $0.40 went to AI-crypto companies (up from $0.18). Ritual, Fetch.AI, Grass building agent-to-agent commerce. Coinbase, Solana, Polygon integrating AI inference into wallets.
- **RWA Tokenization:** On-chain RWAs tripled from ~$5.5B to ~$18.6B in 2025. 2026 focus shifting from tokenized Treasuries to private credit and real estate. SEC DTC tokenization pilot approved.
- **DePIN:** Getting a second act via AI compute demand. Akash, io.net attracting inference workloads. Edge inference well-suited for DePIN architecture.
- **Meme coins:** Quiet this week amid risk-off environment. Speculative narratives losing relevance to structural plays.

---

## 5. DeFi

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total DeFi TVL | >$100B |
| Lending TVL | $58.3B (+6.6% WoW) |
| Aave v3 (ETH) | $46.3B (79.5% of lending) |

**Notes:**
- DeFi TVL holding up relatively well despite spot market carnage
- Aave dominance is remarkable — nearly 80% of tracked lending
- Yield trends compressing in risk-off environment

---

## 6. Stablecoin Flows

| Stablecoin | Market Cap | Change |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| USDT | ~$186.3B | +$1.05B (expanding) |
| USDC | ~$72B | -$640M (contracting) |
| DAI | ~$4.6B | Stable |
| Total Stablecoin Mcap | ~$311B | — |

**Signal:** USDT expanding while USDC contracts = retail/offshore capital still entering via Tether, but institutional/regulated capital (USDC) pulling back. Tron dominates USDT settlement (+$1B net inflows) as the primary offshore layer. This divergence is a bearish institutional signal.

---

## 7. Institutional / ETF Flows

### Bitcoin Spot ETFs

| Date | Net Flow | Notable |
|------|----------|---------|
| Feb 2 (Sun recap) | +$561.8M | Massive inflow day |
| Feb 3 | -$272M | FBTC -$148.7M, GBTC -$56.6M; IBIT +$60M |
| Feb 4-5 | Heavy outflows | Selloff acceleration |
| Week total (BTC+ETH) | ~-$750M combined | Per The Block |

- **IBIT** (BlackRock): Only consistent positive-flow BTC ETF; $60M inflow even on Feb 3 outflow day
- **FBTC** (Fidelity): Led outflows multiple days; -$148.7M on Feb 3 alone
- **GBTC** (Grayscale): Continued bleeding; -$56.6M on Feb 3
- Since Nov 2025, spot BTC ETF complex has shed ~$6.18B net — longest sustained outflow streak since launch
- BTC ETF AUM has fallen below $100B

### Ethereum Spot ETFs

- $447M net outflows across five sessions in early Feb
- ETHA (BlackRock) saw largest single withdrawal: -$264M
- Brief reversal Feb 3: +$15M net (ETHA +$43.8M)
- Total AUM: ~$15.86B (4.9% of ETH supply)
- Third straight month of net selling

### XRP Spot ETFs

- Bucking the trend: +$19.5M inflows on Feb 3
- 7 XRP spot ETFs trading in US; combined AUM ~$1B
- $1.3B+ total inflows since launch; no month of net redemptions yet
- Hit record weekly volume while BTC/ETH bled

---

## 8. Regulatory Landscape

- **SEC "Project Crypto":** Commission-wide initiative to modernize securities rules for on-chain finance. Aims to bring crypto asset distributions back to the US.
- **SEC Chair Atkins:** Pledged "innovation exemption" for crypto startups — lighter requirements with basic consumer protections. Shift from enforcement-first to guidance-first approach.
- **DTC Tokenization Pilot:** SEC no-action letter allows DTC to run a 3-year pilot tokenizing DTC-custodied assets (launch H2 2026).
- **Stablecoin Framework:** Licensing, custody, capital, and compliance requirements expected to be finalized by mid-2026.
- **SEC-CFTC Cooperation:** Increased interagency coordination expected to define jurisdictional boundaries.
- **Market Structure Bill:** Slowing to a crawl in Congress; industry now betting on SEC rulemaking instead.

**Assessment:** Regulatory environment is the most constructive it has been in years. Pro-innovation SEC + CFTC cooperation + tokenization pilots = long-term bullish infrastructure. However, none of this is providing near-term price support amid macro headwinds.

## 9. Macro Correlation

| Asset | YTD Performance | Correlation Signal |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| BTC | ~flat to slightly positive YTD | Trading as high-beta risk asset |
| Gold | +12.6% YTD | Safe haven bid on tariffs + geopolitics |
| S&P 500 | Negative (tech selloff week) | BTC sold off alongside tech |

**Key Points:**
- BTC continues to trade as a risk asset, not digital gold — correlated with tech/Nasdaq on the downside
- Gold surging on geopolitical uncertainty + dollar weakness; BTC failing to capture safe-haven flows
- Polymarket odds: Gold 47% to be best 2026 performer vs BTC 39% vs S&P 14%
- Global liquidity trending lower since mid-2025 — historically negative for BTC and high-beta assets
- Bloomberg: BTC now trails S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and gold over a 5-year horizon

## 10. Sentiment & Derivatives

| Metric | Value | Signal |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Fear & Greed Index | 5-9 (Extreme Fear) | Lowest since June 2022 (TerraLUNA) |
| Weekly Liquidations | >$2B | Cascade selling |
| BTC Funding Rate | +0.51% (70.2% APR) | Still positive but declining |
| ETH Funding Rate | +0.56% (76.4% APR) | Elevated leverage |
| Open Interest | ~$84.1B | +11.3% WoW (traders adding exposure into dip) |

**Sentiment Timeline:**
- Start of 2026: Fear & Greed at 61 (Greed)
- Last month: 42 (Fear)
- Last week: 16 (Extreme Fear)
- Feb 6: 5-9 (Extreme Fear — FTX-era lows)

**Reading:** The extreme fear reading at FTX-collapse levels historically signals capitulation and potential bottom formation. However, funding rates remain positive (longs still dominant), suggesting the leverage flush may not be complete. Open interest rising into the dip shows new positions being added — which could fuel another liquidation cascade if support at $65K fails.

---

## Week Thesis

This was a capitulation event. The convergence of yen carry trade unwinding, miner distress from the winter storm, sustained ETF outflows, and cascading liquidations produced the worst weekly drawdown since FTX. The Fear & Greed Index at 5 and the largest mining difficulty drop since China's 2021 ban are extreme readings that historically mark bottoms — but only if macro conditions stabilize.

**Bull case:** Extreme fear = contrarian buy signal. Regulatory tailwinds strongest in crypto history. Retail accumulating. Hash rate drop is temporary (weather-driven). Friday's +10% bounce shows demand exists below $65K.

**Bear case:** Institutional outflows accelerating (6 months of net ETF selling). Global liquidity tightening. BTC-gold divergence widening. Funding rates still positive = more longs to liquidate. Hong Kong hedge fund contagion risk not fully priced.

**Positioning signal:** Watch $65K as the line in the sand. A sustained break below reopens $55K-$58K (2024 accumulation zone). ETF flow reversal from outflows to inflows would be the clearest bullish signal. The USDT/USDC divergence (retail in, institutions out) is a yellow flag.
