# Eagle Eye Weekly Report: US Equities & Sectors

**Week 06 | February 3-7, 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

A tale of two markets this week. The Dow Jones broke through 50,000 for the first time in history, surging 1,207 points (+2.47%) on Friday alone, powered by a violent rotation out of software/tech and into value, financials, and industrials. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq fell 1.8% on the week as Anthropic's Claude legal plugin triggered a $285B rout in software stocks on Tuesday, and mega-cap tech earnings (Amazon, Alphabet) spooked investors with massive 2026 capex guidance. The S&P 500 finished roughly flat (-0.1%) thanks to Friday's rebound led by chipmakers NVDA (+7.8%) and AVGO (+7.2%). The Russell 2000 continued its 2026 outperformance, now +7% YTD. The VIX spiked above 23 mid-week before collapsing to ~17.8 on Friday's rally.

**Key themes:** Software disruption fears (Anthropic legal AI), mega-cap capex shock (GOOGL $185B, AMZN guidance miss), Dow 50K rotation into value, and a chip dip-buy on Friday.

## 1. Major Indices Weekly Performance

| Index | Friday Close | Weekly Change | Weekly % | YTD % |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------|-------|
| **S&P 500** | 6,932.30 | -7 pts | -0.1% | ~+1.5% |
| **Nasdaq Composite** | 23,031.21 | -421 pts | -1.8% | ~+1.0% |

| **Dow Jones** | 50,115.67 | +1,207 pts | +2.5% | +4.3% |

**Key observations:**
- **Dow 50,000 milestone** -- first close above 50K on Friday Feb 6, driven by financials, industrials, and healthcare rotation
- **Russell 2000 leads 2026** -- small caps up 7% YTD, benefiting from domestic-focused value rotation and broadening market breadth
- **Nasdaq worst week since April 2025** tariff selloff (before Friday's recovery pared losses)
- **S&P 500 equal-weight** hit fresh all-time high, confirming the breadth rotation away from mega-cap tech

## 2. Sector Rotation: SPDR Sector ETF Performance

| ETF | Sector | Weekly Approx. Change | Trend |
|-----|--------|----------------------|-------|
| **XLF** | Financials | +3.5% | LEADER -- rotation beneficiary, banks rallying |
| **XLI** | Industrials | +2.8% | LEADER -- Dow components, value rotation |
| **XLV** | Health Care | +2.2% | Strong -- Eli Lilly earnings beat drove sector |
| **XLU** | Utilities | +1.5% | Steady -- defensive/yield play |
| **XLP** | Consumer Staples | +1.0% | Modest gains -- PepsiCo earnings Friday |
| **XLB** | Materials | +0.8% | Modest -- gold/commodity support |
| **XLRE** | Real Estate | +0.5% | Flat to slight positive |
| **XLE** | Energy | -0.5% | Slight drag -- oil soft this week |
| **XLC** | Communication Services | -1.5% | Weak -- GOOGL capex fears, Anthropic impact |
| **XLY** | Consumer Discretionary | -2.0% | Weak -- AMZN earnings miss dragged sector |
| **XLK** | Technology | -2.5% | LAGGARD -- software rout, Anthropic fears |

**Sector narrative:** A classic risk-off rotation from growth to value. The Goldman Sachs US software basket fell 6% on Tuesday alone (worst day since April tariff selloff). Financials and industrials absorbed the outflows, driving the Dow to its historic milestone. The rotation was broad-based, with S&P 500 equal-weight outperforming cap-weighted.

## 4. Earnings Preview: Next Week (Feb 10-14)

## 5. Market Breadth Indicators

| Indicator | Value | Signal |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| NYSE A-D Line | New all-time high (Feb 4) | Bullish -- liquidity plentiful |
| Hindenburg Omen | 3rd occurrence in 6 trading days (Feb 5) | Cautionary -- divergence between A-D and new highs/lows |
| S&P 500 Equal-Weight vs Cap-Weight | Equal-weight outperforming | Bullish breadth -- rotation away from mega-cap concentration |
| Russell 2000 vs Nasdaq | Small caps +3.5% vs Nasdaq -1.8% | Strong breadth -- value/small cap leadership |
| Dow vs Nasdaq spread | +4.3 pts (largest weekly gap in months) | Confirms rotation theme |

**Interpretation:** Breadth is healthy at the surface level (NYSE A-D line at ATH, equal-weight outperforming), but the Hindenburg Omen cluster warrants monitoring. The divergence between the Dow hitting records and the Nasdaq selling off reflects a market that is broadening but also repricing growth/software risk.

## 6. VIX & Volatility

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| VIX Close (Friday) | ~17.76 |
| VIX Weekly High | ~23.10 |
| VIX Weekly Low | ~17.76 |
| VIX Weekly Change | -18.4% (collapsed from mid-week spike) |
| VIX 1-Month Range | 14.43 - 23.10 |

**Term structure:** VIX spiked above 23 on Tuesday/Wednesday during the Anthropic-driven software selloff and tech earnings volatility, then collapsed back below 18 on Friday's broad rally. The rapid round-trip suggests the market views the software disruption as sector-specific rather than systemic. VIX term structure returned to contango by Friday close, which is the normal (non-stressed) configuration.

---

## 7. Options Flow & Sentiment

| Indicator | Value | Signal |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| CBOE Equity Put/Call Ratio | Elevated mid-week, normalized Friday | Fear spike reversed |
| NVDA options | Heavy call buying on Friday dip (+7.8% rally) | Dip-buyers aggressive on semis |
| Software puts | Significant put volume on TRI, LZ, WDAY, NOW | Hedging/bearish bets on software names |
| SPY options | Put volume elevated mid-week | Institutional hedging during selloff |

**Notable flow:** Friday's chip rally was accompanied by aggressive call buying in NVDA and AVGO, suggesting institutional conviction that the AI infrastructure trade is intact even as software names get repriced. The put/call ratio spiked mid-week to bearish levels (>1.0) but normalized by Friday's close.

## Key Takeaways & Forward Look

1. **The Great Rotation is real.** Dow 50K + Russell 2000 at +7% YTD while Nasdaq lags at +1% marks the most decisive value rotation since 2022. Financials, industrials, and healthcare are absorbing outflows from growth/software.

2. **AI infrastructure trade is intact, but software is being repriced.** The chip dip-buy on Friday (NVDA +7.8%, AVGO +7.2%) shows conviction in AI picks-and-shovels. But Anthropic's legal plugin marks a new phase: AI is now directly threatening incumbent software business models. The $285B Tuesday rout in software/fintech was a warning shot.

3. **Mega-cap capex is a double-edged sword.** Alphabet's $185B 2026 capex and Amazon's massive spending plans are great for infrastructure suppliers (NVDA, AVGO, VRT, ETN) but spooked investors worried about returns on that spend. The 4% monetization problem (from the AI thesis) is front of mind.

4. **Palantir is the AI software outlier.** +70% revenue growth, FY26 guide $1B above consensus -- PLTR is proving the enterprise AI monetization thesis while other software names get hammered. The 189x P/E debate continues.

5. **Nuclear: CEG pullback is Calpine-driven, not thesis-breaking.** The -14% drop in CEG reflects regulatory friction on the Calpine acquisition (DOJ/FERC divestitures), not deterioration in the nuclear thesis. NexGen CNSC hearing Feb 9-13 is the key nuclear catalyst next week.

6. **Watch next week:** Fed Chair Powell testimony (Feb 12), CPI data, and earnings from CSCO (AI networking), AMAT (semi equipment), and CEG (Feb 19). Powell's testimony could set the tone for rate expectations through Q1.
