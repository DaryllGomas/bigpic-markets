# Rates, Credit & Fed -- Week Ending 2026-02-06

## Treasury Yields

The dominant story this week was a sharp rally in Treasuries mid-week driven by a string of weak labor market data, followed by a partial rebound on Friday. The January jobs report -- originally scheduled for February 6 -- was delayed due to a partial government shutdown, leaving markets in an unusual data vacuum heading into the weekend.

| Maturity | Feb 6 Close | Jan 30 Close | Weekly Change (bps) | 1-Month Change (approx.) |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 2-Year   | 3.50%       | 3.52%        | -2 bps              | -15 bps from ~3.65% mid-Jan |
| 5-Year   | 3.57%       | 3.60%        | -3 bps              | -18 bps from ~3.75% mid-Jan |
| 10-Year  | 3.98%       | 4.01%        | -3 bps              | -28 bps from ~4.26% mid-Jan |
| 30-Year  | 4.85%       | 4.87%        | -2 bps              | -12 bps from ~4.97% mid-Jan |

**Intra-week dynamics:** Thursday (Feb 5) saw the biggest move of the week after initial jobless claims surged to 231,000 (vs. 212,000 expected) and Wednesday's ADP report showed only 22,000 private payrolls added in January. The 10-year dropped 8 bps to 3.97% and the 2-year fell 9 bps to 3.47% on Thursday alone. Friday saw a modest 1-3 bps rebound across the curve as markets digested the data without the scheduled BLS employment report.

## Yield Curve

| Spread        | Feb 6 Level | Jan 30 Level | Weekly Change | Status |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| 2s10s Spread  | +48 bps     | +49 bps      | -1 bp         | Positively sloped |
| 3m10y Spread  | ~+15 bps    | ~+15 bps     | Flat          | Barely positive |

The 2s10s spread has been positively sloped since late 2024 after its historic inversion, and widened to its largest level since January 2022 in recent weeks per Seeking Alpha. The spread settled near +48 bps on Friday, essentially flat for the week. The 3m10y spread remains barely positive at approximately +15 bps, having normalized from deeply negative territory through 2024. The curve is in a classic bull-flattening pattern -- the long end rallied slightly more than the short end during the mid-week risk-off move but gave most of it back Friday.

**Narrative:** The yield curve shape reflects a market that sees the Fed on hold in the near term with eventual easing later in 2026, while long-duration yields face competing pressures from record corporate bond issuance and slowing growth concerns.

## Fed Policy

### January 28 FOMC Decision

The Fed held the federal funds rate at **3.50%-3.75%** at its January 28 meeting, pausing after three consecutive 25 bps cuts. The vote was **10-2**, with Governors Miran and Waller dissenting in favor of another 25 bps cut.

Key highlights from Powell's press conference:
- Economy on "firm footing," current rate level is "not restrictive"
- Core PCE at 3.0% (12-month ending December) -- no progress year-over-year, but most of the overshoot is in goods prices tied to tariffs
- Fed views tariff-driven inflation as a one-time price level adjustment, not persistent inflation -- expects it to "top out" in mid-2026 quarters
- Policy is "well positioned" and "not on a preset course"
- Two dissents signal internal debate about whether the pause is appropriate

### Fed Speakers This Week

| Speaker | Date | Key Points |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Vice Chair Bowman** | Jan 30 (prior week, but resonated this week) | Economy continues to grow; labor market fragile beneath the surface; projects **3 rate cuts** in 2026; sees less restrictive regulation + AI investment boosting productivity and keeping inflation on downward path |
| **Gov. Lisa Cook** | Feb 4 | Spoke on economic outlook; supportive of current hold |
| **Vice Chair Jefferson** | Feb 6 | Cautiously optimistic; expects 2.2% GDP growth (similar to 2025); labor market stabilizing; inflation returning toward 2% target; **productivity growth from AI investment can help curb inflation**; policy "well positioned" |

Jefferson's Brookings Institution speech on February 6 was the most notable of the week. His emphasis on supply-side disinflation dynamics -- particularly AI-driven productivity gains -- was taken as moderately dovish, suggesting the Fed sees a path to lower inflation without needing to keep rates elevated indefinitely.

## Rate Expectations

| Meeting Date | Hold Probability | 25 bps Cut | 50+ bps Cut | Market Pricing |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| March 18, 2026 | ~77% | ~23% | <1% | Likely hold |
| June 2026 | ~45% | ~40% | ~15% | First cut most likely here |
| Sept 2026 | ~25% | ~40% | ~35% | Second cut priced |
| Dec 2026 | ~15% | ~30% | ~55% | Third cut possible |

**Full-year 2026 expectations:** Markets price at most **two rate cuts** in 2026, with the first cut most likely in June. CME FedWatch shows a 32.5% probability of 50 bps cumulative cuts by year-end, 25.9% for 75 bps, and 11.7% for 100 bps. Futures markets see no cuts in 2027 regardless of the next Fed Chair.

Vice Chair Bowman's projection of 3 cuts in 2026 is slightly more dovish than market pricing, while Powell's "not on a preset course" language keeps optionality open.

## Credit Markets

### Investment Grade

| Metric | Current Level | Trend |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| IG OAS (ICE BofA) | ~78 bps | 2nd percentile over 20-year lookback (very tight) |
| LQD Price | $110.56 (Feb 7) | 52-wk range: $103.45-$112.93 |
| LQD Yield | 4.43% | Stable |

IG spreads remain historically tight at approximately 78 bps, near post-GFC lows. The Breckinridge Q1 2026 outlook notes that while tight spreads may limit excess returns vs. Treasuries, above-average all-in yields (4.4%+) make IG corporates attractive for buy-and-hold investors. Schwab's 2026 outlook maintains a modest overweight to IG with a defensive posture given tight valuations.

### High Yield

| Metric | Current Level | Trend |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| HY OAS (ICE BofA) | ~286 bps | Near long-term mean; widened from 2024 lows |
| HYG Price | $80.81 (Feb 8) | 52-wk range: $75.08-$81.36; near highs |
| HYG Yield | 5.72% | Stable |
| JNK Price | $94.41 | +0.34% on week |

HY spreads at ~286 bps have widened from the near-historic tights of late 2024 back toward their long-term mean. This is a healthy normalization rather than stress signal -- defaults remain contained and the all-in yield of 5.7%+ continues to attract demand. JNK's 1-year total return of 7.50% (including dividends) reflects the carry trade that has been working in high yield.

### Notable Issuance Trends

Global bond sales reached **$1 trillion at the fastest pace ever** by early February 2026, with corporations and governments borrowing ~$260 billion in the year's first week alone -- a record. Wall Street expects gross IG issuance to hit **$2+ trillion** for full-year 2026, eclipsing the 2020 record of $2.1 trillion. JPMorgan estimates >$1 trillion of corporate debt needs refinancing in 2026, with M&A-funded deals (Kraft Heinz, AT&T, Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery) adding to supply.

The supply surge matters: when primary markets get crowded, spreads can widen even if default risk is low. This is the key tension for credit markets in 2026 -- strong technicals (investor demand) vs. potentially overwhelming supply.

## Lending & Liquidity

### Government Shutdown Impact

A partial government shutdown that began in late January/early February forced the BLS to delay the January Employment Situation report from February 6 to **February 11**. The CPI report was pushed to February 13. The JOLTS report was also delayed. This data vacuum created uncertainty in bond markets and amplified the reaction to the weak ADP and jobless claims data mid-week.

### Key Labor Market Signals (Pre-NFP)

| Data Point | Reading | Expectation | Signal |
|------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| ADP Private Payrolls (Jan) | +22,000 | Higher | Very weak; below Dec's +37,000 |
| Initial Jobless Claims (week ending Jan 31) | 231,000 | 212,000 | Significant miss; +22K from prior week |

These data points drove the mid-week Treasury rally and reinforced the narrative that the labor market is softening, even as the Fed characterizes it as "stabilizing near full employment."

### Record Corporate Issuance as a Liquidity Signal

The record pace of corporate bond issuance ($260B in the first week of 2026) signals ample market liquidity and strong investor demand for yield. Companies are rushing to lock in rates while credit conditions remain favorable. This is a positive signal for the credit cycle but creates potential supply indigestion risk if demand falters.

## Thesis Watchlist -- Rate-Sensitive Movers

Tickers drawn from all 9 BigPic sector thesis files, filtered for rate sensitivity (utilities, REITs, high-duration growth, capital-intensive companies, and leveraged names).

| Ticker | Thesis Sector | Feb 6 Close (approx.) | Weekly % (est.) | Rate Sensitivity Note |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| CEG | Nuclear Energy | ~$261 | +5.8% | Benefits from falling yields; 20-yr hyperscaler PPAs reduce rate risk; 22.6 GW nuclear fleet |
| VST | Nuclear Energy | ~$150 | +4.6% | Meta 2.6 GW deal provides contracted cash flows; lower rates improve project IRRs |
| ALB | Critical Minerals / Energy Storage | ~$163 | -4.3% | Lithium mining capex-intensive; lower rates improve project economics; $19B market cap |
| FLNC | Energy Storage | ~$14.50 | +17.2% | $5.5B backlog grid storage; capital-intensive projects benefit from lower financing costs |
| CRWV | AI Infrastructure | ~IPO levels | N/A | $863M GAAP loss; heavily leveraged neocloud; existential sensitivity to borrowing costs |
| VRT | AI Infrastructure | ~$105 | Modest decline | Power/cooling infrastructure; $9.5B backlog; capex-intensive but strong pricing power |
| PLTR | Defense / Cybersecurity / AI | ~$117 | +30.4% (post-earnings) | High-duration growth stock; 190x P/E; extreme sensitivity to discount rate changes |
| FCX | Critical Minerals | ~$43 | -2.1% | Copper mining; rate cuts improve commodity demand outlook; Grasberg restart Q2 2026 |
| QS | Energy Storage | ~$7.50 | -3.5% | Pre-revenue solid-state; Eagle Line pilot Feb 2026; binary outcome, rate-sensitive valuation |
| IONQ | Quantum Computing | ~$43 | -5.2% | Pre-revenue quantum; 141x P/S; falling rates support growth stock multiples |
| OKTA | Cybersecurity (Identity) | ~$100 | +2.1% | Post-breach recovery; 5.3x forward revenue; benefits from lower discount rates |
| O | N/A (REIT proxy) | ~$56 | +1.5% | Rate-sensitive REIT; identified by analysts as recovery play if easing cycle begins |
| RUN | Energy Storage (VPP) | ~$14 | +3.8% | 106K VPP customers; capital-intensive residential solar+storage; rate-sensitive |
| LAC | Critical Minerals | ~$4.80 | -2.0% | Pre-production lithium; $1.97B DOE loan; lower rates reduce financing costs |
| EOSE | Energy Storage (LDES) | ~$6.20 | +8.5% | $303M DOE loan; 35x YoY revenue growth; lower rates improve project economics |

**Key observations:**
- Nuclear utilities (CEG, VST) had a strong week as yields dropped and the AI power demand narrative remained intact
- PLTR's massive weekly gain was earnings-driven (Q4 2025 blowout), not rate-driven, but its high-duration profile means lower rates amplify the upside
- Capital-intensive energy storage names (FLNC, EOSE, RUN) benefited from the yield decline as lower financing costs improve grid storage project IRRs
- Lithium miners (ALB, FCX) weakened despite lower rates, likely due to commodity-specific concerns separate from the rate picture
- Pre-revenue/high-duration names (QS, IONQ, CRWV) remain the most rate-sensitive -- any shift toward easing would disproportionately benefit these multiples
