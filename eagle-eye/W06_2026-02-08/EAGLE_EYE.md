# Eagle Eye Weekly — W06 | Week Ending 2026-02-06

## This Week's Take

**The Great Rotation accelerated.** Two seismic forces collided this week — Anthropic's Claude Cowork launch triggered a $300B SaaS wipeout ("SaaSpocalypse"), while the Dow crossed 50,000 for the first time in history, powered by a furious rotation into industrials, materials, and financials. Meanwhile, a tariff-fueled US-EU standoff over Greenland sent crypto into its worst week since FTX, with Bitcoin flash-crashing to $60,255 and $2.6B in leveraged positions liquidated in 24 hours.

The macro picture is one of structural divergence: Old Economy cyclicals are outperforming as tariff-driven reshoring and AI infrastructure spend create real-world demand for copper, power, and defense. But the "4% monetization problem" — hyperscalers spending $200B+ on AI capex with limited near-term revenue proof — is weighing on tech multiples. The Fed remains on hold at 3.50-3.75%, but weak labor data (ADP +22K, claims 231K) and a delayed jobs report have the bond market pricing two cuts by year-end with the first likely in June.

**Key signal:** The Russell 2000 (+3.6%) massively outperformed the S&P 500 (-0.1%) and Nasdaq (-1.8%). When small caps lead, money is rotating into the real economy.

## Sector Heatmap

| Rank | Sector | ETF | Weekly % | Signal |
|------|--------|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | Industrials | XLI | +2.9% | Rotation leader — CAT +6%, infrastructure/tariff play |
| 2 | Basic Materials | XLB | +2.5% | Old Economy bid, commodity strength |
| 3 | Energy | XLE | +2.0% | Nuclear/AI power demand, oil stable |
| 4 | Financials | XLF | +1.9% | Goldman +4%, rate stabilization |
| 5 | Healthcare | XLV | +1.9% | Mixed — NVO -15% but rotation inflows |
| 6 | Consumer Discretionary | XLY | +1.5% | Airlines surging (DAL +7%, UAL +8%) |
| 7 | Real Estate | XLRE | +1.0% | Rate-sensitive, modest rotation benefit |
| 8 | Utilities | XLU | +0.6% | Nuclear names strong (CEG, VST) but sector flat |
| 9 | Communication Services | XLC | +0.5% | GOOGL flat post-earnings despite beat |
| 10 | Consumer Staples | XLP | +0.3% | Defensive lag in risk-on rebound |
| 11 | Technology | XLK | -1.5% | SaaSpocalypse drag; SaaS names hit hardest |

**Rotation narrative:** Capital is fleeing high-multiple AI/SaaS growth into Old Economy value. Three drivers: (1) AI agent displacement fears (Claude Cowork), (2) tariff-driven "buy American" reshoring, (3) growing skepticism of hyperscaler capex ROI ($200B AMZN, $175-185B GOOGL guidance spooked investors).

## Positioning & Thesis Update

### Conviction Changes
| Thesis | Direction | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| AI Infrastructure | **Cautious** (downgrade from neutral) | $200B AMZN + $175-185B GOOGL capex guidance spooked market; "4% monetization problem" intensifying; SaaSpocalypse signals downstream AI disruption fears |
| Nuclear Energy | **Bullish** (maintain) | CEG +5.8%, VST +4.6%; power demand thesis intact; rotation into "physical AI" infrastructure beneficiaries |
| Critical Minerals | **Bullish** (maintain) | MP +8.3%, NdPr +15% YTD; structural deficits in copper, uranium, rare earths; China export controls tightening |
| Defense | **Bullish** (maintain) | LMT +3%, RTX +4%, RKLB +5%; tariff-driven reshoring + geopolitical tensions = sustained demand |
| Energy Storage | **Neutral** (maintain) | Mixed signals; EOSE +8.5% but FLNC volatile; rate sensitivity high; QS binary outcome ahead |
| Cybersecurity | **Cautious** (downgrade from neutral) | CRWD -5%, PANW -4%; strong fundamentals but caught in SaaS rotation headwind; may take time to re-rate |
| Quantum Computing | **Speculative** (maintain) | IONQ rebounded +14.2% on Feb 6; Q4 earnings Feb 25 is key; pre-revenue, high-duration |
| Robotics | **Neutral** (maintain) | SYM +3% on industrial rotation; ISRG -2% on multiple compression |
| Space | **Bullish** (upgrade from neutral) | RKLB +5%; defense space spending accelerating; SDA contracts |

### Key Risks
1. **Delayed data release whipsaw:** NFP (Feb 11) and CPI (Feb 12) back-to-back could create extreme volatility
2. **SaaSpocalypse contagion:** If AI displacement fears spread beyond SaaS to broader tech, the rotation could accelerate
3. **Crypto leverage rebuild:** $2.6B liquidation cleared leverage but fast recovery to $70K may rebuild speculative positions before structural issues resolve
4. **Credit supply indigestion:** Record $1T bond issuance pace could widen spreads if demand falters
5. **US-Iran talks escalation:** New sanctions post-Oman talks + unresolved nuclear issues = oil supply risk
