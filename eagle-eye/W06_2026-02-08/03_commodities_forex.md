## Energy

### Crude Oil

| Benchmark | Close (Feb 6) | Weekly Change | YTD Change | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| WTI Crude | ~$63.70/bbl | Down (first weekly decline in 7 weeks) | Approx. flat | Rebounded Friday on US-Iran talk uncertainty |
| Brent Crude | ~$68.05/bbl | Down (first weekly decline in 7 weeks) | Approx. flat | Choppy trading; eased Middle East risk weighed |

**Drivers:**
- **US-Iran nuclear talks in Oman (Feb 6):** Iran's FM Araghchi called the indirect talks "a good start" with further rounds planned. US Central Command's Admiral Cooper was at the table for the first time, signaling the seriousness of the military dimension. Markets initially sold on easing supply disruption fears, then reversed as disagreements over agenda emerged. The US rolled out new sanctions on Iranian oil and 14 vessels immediately after the session concluded.

- **Saudi Arabia cut March OSP for Arab Light to Asia by $0.30** (to +$0.30/bbl premium) -- the fourth consecutive monthly cut. This reflects abundant supply and soft Asian demand as China enters Lunar New Year. The IEA projects global oil supply will surpass demand by 3.84M bpd in 2026.

- **OPEC+ held production steady** through Q1 2026 (pause on planned increases), citing seasonal demand patterns. Eight key producers reaffirmed commitment at the Jan 4 virtual meeting. [Source: CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/04/opec-keeps-oil-output-steady-amid-turmoil-among-members.html)

### Natural Gas

| Benchmark | Close (Feb 6) | Daily Change | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Henry Hub | $3.42/MMBtu | -2.48% | Pulling back from recent highs near late-2022 levels |

Natural gas has been elevated in early 2026 on winter demand. The pullback on Feb 6 reflects moderating weather forecasts and adequate storage. Prices remain well above the sub-$2 levels of mid-2025, supported by rising LNG export capacity and data center power demand.

## Precious Metals

| Metal | Close (Feb 6) | Weekly Change | YTD Change | Notes |
|-------|---------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Gold | ~$4,930-4,950/oz | Volatile; ~+3.5% on Friday; tracking for second consecutive weekly loss | Down from $5,100+ Jan highs | Record $121 silver Jan 29 triggered wave of forced liquidations across PMs |
| Silver | ~$77.98/oz | +10.08% on Feb 6 alone; volatile week | Down sharply from $121 Jan 29 record | Margin hikes triggered massive liquidations; UBS targets $100 by March |

**Drivers:**
- Gold rallied above $4,950 on Friday after sharp two-way moves all week. The volatility was triggered by forced liquidations following gold and silver repeatedly hitting record highs in January. Silver's record of $121/oz on Jan 29 led to exchange margin hikes, cascading sell-offs, and the erasure of all YTD gains within days.
- **Safe-haven demand** was supported by weaker US labor data: weekly initial jobless claims rose to 231K, and announced job cuts jumped to ~108K in January (Challenger). [Source: Fortune](https://fortune.com/article/current-price-of-gold-02-06-2026/), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/will-gold-silver-price-rise-2026-sell-off-slv-spot.html)
- UBS forecasts silver will return to $100 by March before declining to $85 by year-end. The extreme volatility underscores the risk of momentum-driven crowded trades in precious metals.
- Gold is up ~145% from year-ago levels, supported by central bank purchases, real rate concerns, and geopolitical uncertainty.

## Industrial Metals & Critical Minerals

### Copper

| Metric | Value | Weekly Change | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Copper (LME) | ~$5.77/lb (Feb 6) | Worst week since late November | Lowest in ~6 weeks |

- Copper fell to its lowest level in six weeks, pressured by Chinese buyers pulling back ahead of Lunar New Year holidays. Rising inventories at Shanghai, London, and New York warehouses compounded the selling.
- Midweek saw a sharp +5% one-day rally (Tuesday) -- the best since Nov 2022 -- on a broad metals rebound, but gains were given back by Thursday (-4%).
- **Structural backdrop remains bullish:** ICSG projects a 150,000-tonne copper deficit starting 2026; J.P. Morgan estimates 330,000 MT. Freeport-McMoRan's phased Grasberg restart in Q2 2026 is the key near-term supply catalyst. [Source: Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/copper), [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/copper-outlook-2026-institutional-rotation-supply-deficits-technical-analysis-200673451)

### Uranium

| Metric | Value | Monthly Change | YoY Change |
|--------|-------|----------------|------------|
| Uranium Spot | ~$85.25/lb (Feb 6) | +4.22% (1-month) | +22.40% |

- Uranium pulled back from January's peak of $94.28/lb (end of Jan -- highest since Feb 2024). Spot fell to $85.25 on Feb 6, though the broader trend remains firmly higher.
- **Structural deficit of 30-40M lbs/yr** persists: primary mine production covers only ~75% of reactor requirements. Kazatomprom is guiding 10% below capacity in 2026 for production discipline.
- NexGen Energy's CNSC hearing (Feb 9-13) is the most important near-term catalyst for uranium supply.

### Lithium

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Lithium Carbonate (China futures) | ~CNY 160,000/t (~$22,000/t) | Pulling back from 2-year high of CNY 180,000 (Jan 26) |

- Lithium retreated from its January surge as markets reassessed the magnitude of demand uplift. Chinese authorities had earlier lowered export rebates for battery producers, driving front-running of orders.
- Beijing's announcement to double EV charging capacity to 180 GW by 2027 and expanded power storage investments continue to support the structural outlook.
- Prices remain dramatically higher than early 2025 ($10,000-11,000/t), validating the "lithium winter" bottom thesis.

### Rare Earths (NdPr)

| Metric | Value | YTD Change |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Neodymium | CNY 997,500/t (~$171.70/kg) | +15.00% YTD |
| NdPr Oxide | CNY 687,500/t (~$98,590/t as of Jan 26) | Elevated |

- Rare earth prices remain elevated following China's 2025 export control escalation. NdPr prices surged 40% in 2025 and are up another 15% YTD in 2026.
- The November 2026 expiry of the US-China trade agreement suspension is the single most important catalyst. Analysts assign 35% probability to full reimposition of controls.
- MP Materials posted an 8.33% stock gain on Feb 6, climbing from $56.55 to $61.26.

### Cobalt

| Metric | Value | Monthly Change | YoY Change |
|--------|-------|----------------|------------|
| Cobalt | ~$56,290/t | +2.65% | +161.21% |

- Cobalt remains near multi-year highs following the DRC's 2025 export ban and subsequent quota system (96,000 MT/yr -- roughly half of 2024 volumes). Prices have tripled from 2024 lows.
- Consensus 2026 forecast: ~$25/lb average, easing modestly as the market gradually stabilizes. [Source: Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/cobalt), [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cobalt-market-forecast-top-trends-cobalt-2026)

## US Dollar & Forex

### DXY (US Dollar Index)

| Metric | Value (Feb 6) | Weekly Change | Notes |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| DXY | 97.69 | +0.9% for the week | Safe-haven bid; Warsh nomination overhang |

The dollar gained nearly 0.9% for the week, drawing support from safe-haven demand amid weaker US labor data and a tech sell-off. The nomination of Kevin Warsh as next Fed Chair (preference for smaller balance sheet, cautious easing) continues to support the greenback structurally.

### Major Forex Pairs

| Pair | Level (Feb 6) | Weekly Change | Key Driver |

- The BOE's dovish hold at 3.75% was the week's central bank highlight. The ECB also held rates, with both central banks maintaining a cautious stance.
- The yuan has been relatively stable despite trade tensions, with the PBOC maintaining orderly management of the exchange rate.

## Supply Chains & Trade

### Shipping

| Index | Level (Feb 6) | Weekly Change | Notes |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Baltic Dry Index | 1,923 | Down 5 consecutive days; -3.6% to -0.7% daily declines | Lowest since Jan 23 |

- The BDI fell for a fifth consecutive session, driven by the Capesize index (-1.1% to 2,918) reflecting reduced iron ore shipping demand ahead of Chinese Lunar New Year. Panamax (-0.4% to 1,652) and Supramax (+0.2% to 1,104) were mixed. [Source: Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/baltic)

### Trade Policy Developments

- **25% revenue-sharing tariff on advanced semiconductors** (Presidential Proclamation 11002, Jan 14): Manufacturers selling AI chips to specific foreign markets must remit 25% of sales revenue to the US Treasury. TSMC faces significant logistical hurdles as new regulations require chips to pass through US-based testing labs.
- **South Korean vehicle tariffs hiked from 15% to 25%** (Jan 27) following a breakdown in bilateral trade negotiations -- directly impacting Hyundai/Kia.
- **Pharmaceutical tariffs:** Firms face 100% tariffs on branded drugs that do not participate in new federal discount platforms, or must commit to massive domestic capex.
- **USMCA framework under strain:** Volkswagen and other automakers warn that 25% levies on parts effectively dismantle the cost-efficiency of the existing trade framework.
- **Broader outlook:** UNCTAD and KPMG flag 2026 as a year of continued volatility and uncertainty in global trade and supply chains, with tariffs set to stay as policy focuses on national security and revenue priorities.
