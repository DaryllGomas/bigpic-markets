# Crypto & Alternative Assets — Week Ending 2026-02-06

## Summary

This was the most violent week for crypto markets since the $19B liquidation event of October 2025. The U.S.-EU tariff war over Greenland — with President Trump threatening 10-25% tariffs on eight NATO allies — combined with escalating U.S.-China trade tensions triggered a massive risk-off cascade across digital assets. Bitcoin fell from ~$84,000 to a flash-crash low of $60,255, Ethereum crashed 34.5% weekly to $1,747 intraday, and over $2.6B in leveraged positions were liquidated in a single 24-hour period on February 5. Recovery was swift but partial — BTC reclaimed $70,000 by February 6, and MSTR surged 26% on the rebound. The total crypto market cap fell to approximately $2.4-2.6 trillion. Bitcoin dominance remained elevated near 57-59%, reflecting capital rotation from altcoins into BTC during the panic.

## Bitcoin

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price (Feb 6 close) | ~$70,000 (rebounded from $60,255 intraday low on Feb 5) |
| Weekly High | ~$84,177 |
| Weekly Low | ~$60,255 |
| Weekly Change | Approximately -15% to -22% |
| BTC Dominance | ~57-59% |
| Hash Rate | ~970 EH/s (down from ATH above 1 ZH/s; US winter storms forced curtailment) |
| Mining Difficulty | 141T; next adjustment Feb 8-10 projected at -16% to -18% |
| Total Crypto Market Cap | ~$2.4-2.6 trillion |

**Key Levels:** Support at $60,000-$65,000 (tested and held), with $55,900 and $51,700 as deeper classical pivot supports. Resistance at $74,800, $79,000, $81,000, and $84,000 (prior support now flipped to resistance). Technical sentiment is bearish with MACD in negative territory and no clear bullish divergences.

**On-Chain Snapshot:** Hash rate pulled back 12% from the all-time high above 1 ZH/s reached in January 2026, driven by severe US winter storms forcing large-scale mining curtailment. The expected -16% to -18% difficulty adjustment on February 8-10 (from 141T to ~116-121T) should provide relief for remaining miners. Bitcoin is now more than 50% below its all-time high of ~$126,000 reached in October 2025.

**Context:** The drawdown represents the worst single-week decline since the FTX collapse in 2022. The crash was driven by macro fears — the U.S.-EU tariff escalation over Greenland and ongoing U.S.-China trade war — rather than crypto-specific events. The $2.6B in 24-hour liquidations on Feb 5 (primarily longs at $2.31B) accelerated the selloff but also cleared significant leverage from the system.

---

## Ethereum

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price (Feb 6) | ~$2,073 (intraday range $1,748-$2,094) |
| Weekly Change | Approximately -28% to -34.5% |
| Weekly Low | ~$1,748 (Feb 5 intraday) |
| Staking Yield (avg) | ~3.3% APY |
| Total ETH Staked | 35.86M ETH (~28.9% of supply) |
| Gas Fees | Suppressed; L2 activity absorbing majority of transaction volume |
| L2 Fee Trend | Down 40-60% following recent upgrades |

**Analysis:** Ethereum underperformed Bitcoin significantly during the selloff, falling more than 60% from its July 2025 peak. The ETH/BTC ratio continues to weaken as capital concentrates in Bitcoin during risk-off episodes. The Fusaka upgrade introduced EIP-7918 (Blob Base Fee Bound), establishing a minimum blob price to ensure sustainable base fee burns even during low L1 activity. Individual stakers are projected to rise from ~25% to 30% of total staked ETH in 2026 as institutional flows through ETPs grow.

---

## Altcoin Landscape

| Asset | Price (Feb 6 approx.) | Weekly Change (est.) | Market Cap |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|------------|
| SOL (Solana) | ~$88.80 | -25% to -30% | ~$40B |
| AVAX (Avalanche) | ~$10.15 | -25% to -30% | ~$4.2B |
| LINK (Chainlink) | ~$10-12 | -30%+ | ~$7B |
| DOT (Polkadot) | ~$1.31 | -35%+ (hit ATL of $1.13 on Feb 6) | ~$2B |
| MATIC/POL (Polygon) | Depressed | -30%+ | Reduced |

**Notable:** Polkadot (DOT) hit an all-time low of $1.13 on February 6, 2026, reflecting severe risk-off sentiment in lower-cap altcoins. Solana held above $85 despite the broad selloff, demonstrating relative strength compared to other L1 alternatives. Altcoins broadly underperformed Bitcoin during the crash, consistent with the pattern of BTC dominance rising during panic episodes.

---

## DeFi

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total DeFi TVL (est.) | ~$80-90B (down significantly from peak levels) |
| Top Protocol: Aave | ~$44B TVL (largest lending protocol, operates across 18 chains) |
| Top Protocol: Lido | Second-largest by TVL (liquid staking backbone for ETH) |
| DEX Volume | Elevated during crash (liquidation-driven) |
| Yield Trends | Compressed; stablecoin lending yields in 3-6% range |

**Analysis:** DeFi TVL declined in lockstep with underlying asset prices. Aave maintained its position as the largest decentralized lending protocol with over $44B in TVL across 18 blockchains. Lido remains the backbone of Ethereum staking infrastructure. Uniswap continues as the largest DEX by volume despite ranking lower by TVL. The market crash stress-tested DeFi protocols with elevated liquidation volumes, but no major protocol failures were reported — a sign of infrastructure maturity compared to previous cycles.

---

## Stablecoin Flows

| Stablecoin | Market Cap | Share |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| USDT (Tether) | $187.0B | ~60.2% |
| USDC (Circle) | $75.7B | ~24.5% |
| Total Stablecoin Market | $307.6B | 100% |

**Flow Direction:** Stablecoin market cap remained stable-to-growing through the crash, indicating that capital rotated from volatile crypto assets into stablecoins rather than exiting the ecosystem entirely. USDC continued to outpace USDT in growth rate for the second consecutive year, driven by regulatory compliance demand. Circle's USDC grew 73% in 2025 vs. USDT's 36%. The $307.6B total stablecoin market cap represents a record high, suggesting dry powder remains available for re-entry when sentiment stabilizes.

**Regulatory Overhang:** The Senate Banking Committee's new 278-page draft (released Jan 12, 2026) under the CLARITY Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering yield for simply holding balances — a provision banks lobbied for to protect their deposit base. The GENIUS Act framework from 2025 requires follow-up rulemaking on licensing, custody, and capital requirements expected by mid-2026.

## ETF Flows

### Bitcoin Spot ETFs

| Fund | Recent Daily Flow (early Feb) | Notes |
|------|------------------------------|-------|
| IBIT (BlackRock) | $142M inflow (single day) | Market leader; $287M on first trading day of 2026 |
| FBTC (Fidelity) | $153M inflow (single day) | Led daily flows in early Feb |
| GBTC (Grayscale) | $15M inflow | Modest positive flows |
| **Weekly Net (est.)** | **Likely net outflows for crash week** | Pre-crash inflows reversed by panic selling |

**Context:** Bitcoin spot ETFs started 2026 with $670M in inflows on the first trading day (Jan 2), but momentum stalled. The February crash week likely saw significant net outflows as retail and institutional investors de-risked, though daily-level data during the peak panic remains mixed. The $34B that entered crypto ETFs in 2025 still left most investors underwater due to the 50%+ BTC drawdown from the October ATH.

### Ethereum Spot ETFs

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Weekly Net Outflows (crash week) | ~$170M to $447M (varying by measurement period) |
| ETHA (BlackRock) | -$264M (largest single withdrawal) |
| Total ETH ETF AUM | ~$15.86B (~4.9% of ETH circulating supply) |
| YTD 2026 Net Flows | ~-$32M (net outflows) |

**Analysis:** Ethereum ETFs saw their worst week since inception, with $447M in net outflows across five trading sessions centered around the crash. BlackRock's ETHA accounted for the majority. At $15.86B AUM representing ~4.9% of ETH's circulating supply, ETF flows have an outsized impact on spot price — making the outflow pressure particularly damaging during the selloff.

## Regulatory & Policy

| Development | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| CLARITY Act Draft | Senate Banking Committee released 278-page market structure bill (Jan 12, 2026); prohibits yield on stablecoin balances |
| GENIUS Act Follow-Up | Regulators expected to finalize stablecoin licensing/custody/capital rules by mid-2026 |
| SEC Innovation Exemption | SEC may introduce lighter regulatory sandbox for crypto startups in 2026 |
| OCC Rulemaking | Jan 8, 2026: Proposed rule clarifying national trust bank engagement in banking activities |
| FedRAMP/PQC | CNSA 2.0 compliance deadline Jan 2027 driving post-quantum crypto migration spending |

**Analysis:** The regulatory environment is the most constructive in crypto history, with both market structure and stablecoin legislation advancing simultaneously. The SEC under new leadership appears oriented toward an innovation exemption framework. However, the stablecoin yield prohibition in the CLARITY Act draft is a significant negative for DeFi-adjacent stablecoin protocols and a win for traditional banks. The broader theme is one of increasing regulatory clarity, which should be structurally positive for institutional adoption once the current macro-driven panic subsides.

## Crypto-Equities

| Ticker | Company | Price (Feb 6) | Weekly Change (est.) | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| COIN | Coinbase | ~$146-$166 | -20% to -25% | Down 62% from ATH; earnings Feb 12 |
| MSTR | Strategy (MicroStrategy) | ~$135 | -10% WoW, +26% on Feb 6 rebound | 52-wk range $104-$457; Strong Buy consensus |
| MARA | MARA Holdings | Down ~12% on Feb 5 | -20%+ weekly | Rosenblatt cut PT to $15 from $22 |
| RIOT | Riot Platforms | Down ~10% on Feb 5 | -15%+ weekly | Mining profitability under pressure |
| CLSK | CleanSpark | Declined with sector | -15%+ weekly | HPC diversification provides partial buffer |

**Analysis:** Crypto-equities tracked Bitcoin's crash with amplified volatility. Coinbase fell to its lowest since April 2025, now 62% below its all-time high; Citi cut its price target to $400 from higher levels. MSTR (rebranded to "Strategy") showed extreme volatility — collapsing to $107 before a 26% single-day rebound to $135 on February 6. Bitcoin miners MARA and RIOT face a double headwind: BTC price decline plus persistently high network difficulty, though the expected -16% difficulty adjustment should provide near-term relief. Miners with HPC/AI hosting diversification (MARA, CLSK) have more resilient revenue profiles than pure-play miners.

| USDT/USDC | All (liquidity indicator) | Flat/growing | $307.6B total stablecoin market cap = record; dry powder intact |
