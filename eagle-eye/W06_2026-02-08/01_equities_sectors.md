# Equities & Sectors -- Week Ending 2026-02-06

## Market Summary

The week was defined by a dramatic two-act narrative: a brutal mid-week SaaS/tech selloff dubbed the "SaaSpocalypse" on Wednesday (Feb 4), followed by a historic Friday rebound that saw the Dow Jones close above 50,000 for the first time ever. The selloff was triggered by Anthropic's Claude Cowork launch and broader fears that AI agents are poised to displace traditional SaaS business models, wiping out ~$300B in market cap from software names. The rebound was fueled by strong consumer sentiment data (UMich 57.3 vs 55.0 est.), falling inflation expectations (1Y outlook down to 3.5% from 4.0%), and aggressive dip-buying in cyclicals and industrials.

A broader "Great Sector Rotation" theme dominated: capital continued fleeing high-multiple AI/SaaS growth stocks into Old Economy value sectors (basic materials, energy, industrials), reinforced by tariff-driven "buy American" tailwinds and strong earnings from industrial bellwethers.

| Index | Close (Feb 6) | Weekly % | YTD % |
|-------|--------------|----------|-------|
| S&P 500 | 6,932.30 | -0.1% | +1.3% |
| Nasdaq Composite | 23,031.21 | -1.8% | -0.5% |
| Dow Jones Industrial Average | 50,115.67 | +2.5% | +4.8% |
| Russell 2000 | ~2,700 (est.) | +3.6% | +3.7% |

**Notes:** The S&P 500 closed 2025 at 6,845.50 (+16.4% for the year). The Dow surged 1,206.95 points (+2.47%) on Friday alone, closing above 50,000 for the first time in history. The Nasdaq underperformed despite Friday's 2.18% bounce, weighed down by the mid-week SaaS rout. The Russell 2000 significantly outperformed large caps, consistent with the rotation into value/cyclicals and away from mega-cap tech.

## Sector Performance

| 11 | XLK (Technology) | -1.5% | "SaaSpocalypse" mid-week; SaaS names hit hardest |

## Sector Rotation Analysis

The week crystallized the "Great Sector Rotation of 2026" -- a structural shift that has been building since late 2025. Three forces are driving capital from AI/SaaS growth into Old Economy value:

**1. AI Displacement Fears:** Anthropic's Claude Cowork launch on Feb 4 triggered the "SaaSpocalypse" -- an indiscriminate selloff in SaaS/software stocks as investors realized AI agents could automate tasks that entire enterprise software categories (legal tech, HR, compliance, project management) were built to serve. Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow were hit particularly hard. BofA called the selloff "irrational" and "overblown," drawing parallels to the DeepSeek panic of January 2025.

**2. Tariff-Driven Reshoring:** The "Liberation Day" tariffs (in effect since April 2025) continue to create tailwinds for domestic materials, industrials, and energy producers. Caterpillar (+6%) and GE Aerospace (+5%) were among the week's biggest Dow contributors.

**3. Earnings Quality Divergence:** Industrial and financial earnings delivered strong beats and forward guidance, while tech earnings were mixed. Alphabet beat on revenue (+18% YoY) but spooked investors with $175-185B capex guidance for 2026. Amazon beat on revenue ($213.4B vs $211.3B est.) but shares plunged 8% on $200B capex guidance (vs $146.6B est.). The market is increasingly skeptical of AI infrastructure spend that lacks near-term monetization proof.

**Morningstar noted:** Healthcare, financials, and energy are the three sectors currently trading below fair value, while technology remains the most overvalued.

## Key Earnings

| Company | Ticker | EPS (act vs est) | Revenue (act vs est) | Reaction | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|-------|
| Palantir | PLTR | $0.25 vs $0.23 | $1.41B vs $1.33B (+70% YoY) | +11% Mon | FY26 guide $7.18-7.20B smashed $6.22B consensus; 10th straight quarter of accelerating growth |
| Alphabet | GOOGL | $2.82 vs $2.63 | $113.8B vs $111.4B (+18% YoY) | ~Flat Wed | Cloud +48% to $17.7B, backlog doubled to $240B; but $175-185B capex guidance spooked market |
| AMD | AMD | $1.53 adj vs $1.52 est | $10.3B vs $10.1B est (+34% YoY) | -4% Tue | Record DC revenue $5.4B (+39% YoY); MI350 ramping; Q1 guide slightly soft |
| Amazon | AMZN | $1.95 vs $1.97 | $213.4B vs $211.3B (+14% YoY) | -8% Fri | AWS +24% to $35.6B; but $200B capex guidance (vs $146.6B est) triggered selloff |
| Disney | DIS | $1.34 vs $1.45 est | $26.0B vs $25.2B est (+5% YoY) | -7% Tue | Experiences crossed $10B quarterly revenue; but entertainment OI -35% YoY |
| Novo Nordisk | NVO | $1.02 vs $0.92 | DKK 309B ($45.9B, +10% YoY) | -15% Wed | Beat Q4 but 2026 guidance of -5% to -13% sales/OI decline shocked market |

**Key Takeaway:** The earnings theme was "beat on results, punish on guidance." Companies delivering blowout quarters (PLTR, GOOGL) were rewarded only if guidance was equally strong. Those with massive capex guidance (GOOGL's $175-185B, AMZN's $200B) face growing investor skepticism about AI infrastructure ROI -- directly echoing the "4% monetization problem" identified in our AI Infrastructure thesis.

## Market Breadth

| Indicator | Value | Signal |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| NYSE Advance/Decline (Fri Feb 6) | ~3.5:1 advancers | Strongly positive on Friday's rebound |
| NYSE A/D Line (weekly) | Slightly positive | Breadth improved late-week after mid-week deterioration |
| New 52-Week Highs (NYSE, Fri) | ~180 | Concentrated in industrials, financials, energy |
| New 52-Week Lows (NYSE, Wed) | ~120 | Spike in SaaS/software names during "SaaSpocalypse" |
| S&P 500 stocks above 200-DMA | ~62% | Healthy but below the 70%+ level seen in late Jan |
| Russell 2000 outperformance | +3.6% vs SPX -0.1% | Small caps strongly outperforming -- rotation into value/cyclicals |

**Analysis:** The breadth story is one of divergence. Under the surface, the equal-weight S&P 500 is outperforming the cap-weighted index, confirming that the mega-cap tech leadership of 2024-2025 is broadening. The mid-week spike in 52-week lows (concentrated in SaaS) alongside Friday's surge in 52-week highs (concentrated in industrials/financials) illustrates the rotation in real time. The Russell 2000's significant outperformance (+3.6% vs flat S&P) is another rotation signal.

## Volatility

| Metric | Value | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| VIX Close (Feb 6) | 17.76 | -18.4% on Friday (from 21.77 prior close) |
| VIX Weekly High | ~22+ | Hit during Wed SaaS selloff |
| VIX Weekly Low | ~17.5 | Friday close after rebound |
| VIX Monthly Avg (Feb) | 18.64 | Elevated vs January |

**Analysis:** The VIX spiked above 22 mid-week during the SaaSpocalypse selloff, then collapsed 18% on Friday as the Dow's historic 50K milestone restored confidence. The term structure normalized by Friday (front-month below 3-month), suggesting the mid-week panic was viewed as a one-off event rather than a systemic risk signal. However, the elevated monthly average of 18.64 (vs a long-run average near 19-20) indicates investors remain cautious about tech valuations and the AI monetization gap.
